This policy describes how we handle your data when you use “Times
Services,” listed below:

  - The New York Times newspaper, plus our International Edition
  - Our websites, <span class="css-1msjh1x">like NYTimes.com</span>
  - Our apps, <span class="css-1msjh1x">like the New York Times app and
    the New York Times Crossword app</span>
  - Our email newsletters, <span class="css-1msjh1x">like Cooking and
    Morning Briefing</span>
  - Our pages or ads on social media networks,
    <span class="css-1msjh1x">like our Facebook and Instagram
    pages</span>
  - Anywhere we gather information from you and refer you to this
    Privacy Policy

How we handle information about you depends on which Times Services you
use — and how you use them. We use different information about print
subscribers than website visitors.

Be aware that certain Times Services work differently. Some have
additional terms that supplement this policy
<span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., [Reader
Submissions](https://help.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/hc/en-us/articles/360004901454-Reader-submission-terms))</span>.
Others refer to a different privacy policy altogether, so this one does
not apply.

What Information Do We Gather About
You?

<div class="css-7rj3o4">

</div>

<div id="region-what-information-do-we-gather-about-you" class="accordion-content answer open" data-role="region" data-aria-labelledby="what-information-do-we-gather-about-you">

The information we gather about you depends on the context. By and
large, it’s information about you that can personally identify you —
either on its own or when combined with other information.

The following describes the information we collect and how we obtain it.

**A) Information Collected Through Times Services.**

1.  **Information That You Voluntarily Give Us**
      - **For Registration:**
        
        When you sign up for a Times Service
        <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., a subscription)</span>, we
        collect your contact information and account credentials. Once
        you’re registered, we assign you a unique ID number. This ID
        number helps us recognize you when you’re signed in.
        
        For some Times Services, you can instead sign up by linking your
        Apple, Facebook or Google account. See “[From Other
        Sources](#anchor-question1-sectionB)” below.
        
        If you register for an event or conference, we might ask for
        additional information <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., your
        company name, your job title or your dietary
        restrictions)</span>.
    
      - **For Billing:**
        
        To process payments or donations, we collect and use your
        payment information.
        
        This can include your name, your address, your telephone number,
        your email address, your credit or debit card information and
        any other relevant information.
    
      - **For User-Generated Content:**
        
        We offer you the ability to post content that other users can
        read <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., comments or recipe
        reviews)</span>. Anyone can read, collect and use any personal
        information that accompanies your posts. See the [Comments
        F.A.Q.](https://help.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/hc/en-us/articles/115014792387-Comments),
        or read “[User-Generated
        Content](https://help.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/hc/en-us/articles/115014893428-Terms-of-service#3)”
        in our Terms of Service for more information.
        
        We do not have to publish any of your content. If the law
        requires us to take down, remove or edit your personal
        information, we will comply to the required extent.
    
      - **For Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers:**
        
        When you sign up for these, you give us your name, email and any
        other required information.
    
      - **For Reader Surveys, Research, Panels and Experience
        Programs:**
        
        We gather information through questionnaires, surveys and
        feedback programs. We also conduct similar research for
        advertisers. We ask you for your consent to use this information
        when you participate in these programs and events.
    
      - **During Contact With Our Call Centers:**
        
        We collect information from you when you place an order over the
        phone or contact customer service through one of our toll-free
        numbers.
    
      - **Personal Contacts Data:**
        
        We never scan your device for your contacts or upload this data.
        
        With your consent, we do comply with your requests to collect
        data about your friends, family or acquaintances
        <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., Refer a Friend
        campaigns)</span>. This functionality is only meant for U.S.
        residents. By using it, you acknowledge and agree that both you
        and your contacts are based in the United States — and that you
        have everyone’s consent for us to use their contact information.
2.  **Information Collected Automatically**
      - **With Tracking Technologies in Your Browser and Mobile Apps:**
        
        These technologies include cookies, web beacons, tags and
        scripts, software development kits (or SDKs) and beyond.
        
        We track and store data about how you visit and use Times
        Services, particularly through our websites and apps. The items
        we log include:
        
          - Your IP address
          - Your location
          - Your operating system
          - Your browser
          - Your browser language
          - The URLs of any pages you visit on our sites and apps
          - Device identifiers
          - Advertising identifiers
          - Other usage information.
        
        We combine this data with other information we collect about
        you. For more information about tracking methods on Times
        Services, and how to manage them, read our [Cookie
        Policy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/subscription/dg-cookie-policy/cookie-policy.html).
        
        If your browser doesn’t accept our cookies, you can’t access
        certain parts of our websites <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g.,
        your account on NYTimes.com)</span>. Because the “Do Not Track”
        browser-based standard signal has yet to gain widespread
        acceptance, we don’t currently respond to those signals.
    
      - **With GPS Technologies:**
        
        Some of our apps can provide content based on your GPS location,
        if you enable this feature <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., the
        New York Times Real Estate app)</span>. Your GPS location is
        your exact location.
        
        You choose whether to enable GPS features when you first install
        the app. You can edit that setting on your device at any time.
        If you enable these features, your GPS location can be found by
        satellite, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi and used by the app. If you
        save a location-based search in your history, that data moves to
        our service provider’s servers — see
        [below](#anchor-question2-sectionE) for the definition of
        service provider.
        
        If you do not enable GPS location-based services, or if a
        specific app does not have location-based features
        <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., the New York Times app)</span>,
        we don’t collect your precise GPS location. We do collect your
        IP address, which can establish your approximate location. Ads
        on our sites and apps may be targeted based on this approximate
        location, but are never targeted based on your GPS location.

**B) Information Collected From Other Sources.**

1.  **Privately Owned Databases:**
    
    Marketing, data analytic and social media-owned databases give us
    access to a range of information — like public data, survey data and
    beyond. This data sometimes includes your mailing address, your
    gender, your age, your household income and other demographic data.

2.  **Social Media Platforms and Other Third-Party Services:**
    
    (Social media platforms include Facebook. Third-party services
    include Google, Kindle and Nook.)
    
    You can link your social media or other third-party account to a
    Times Service. By linking the services, you authorize us to collect,
    store and use any information they may give us
    <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., your email address)</span>. You can
    disconnect your NYTimes.com registration from third-party accounts
    at any time.
    
    We also receive information from you when you interact with our
    pages, groups, accounts or posts on social media platforms. This
    includes aggregate data on our followers
    <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., age, gender and location)</span>,
    engagement data <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., “likes,” comments,
    shares, reposts and clicks)</span>, awareness data
    <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., number of impressions and
    reach)</span> and individual users’ public profiles.
    
    For more information, refer to our [social
    login](https://help.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/hc/en-us/articles/115014887628-Social-login),
    [Kindle](https://help.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/hc/en-us/articles/115014889068-Kindle-subscribers)
    and
    [Nook](https://help.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/hc/en-us/articles/115014917867-NOOK-subscribers)
    F.A.Q.

3.  **Workplace and Schools:**
    
    When your employer or school buys an organizationwide subscription
    to NYTimes.com, they sometimes provide us with your name and
    organization email address to grant you access as a user.

**A note about future updates:**

We are always improving our products and services, and we create new
features regularly. These updates sometimes require us to collect new
information, or use what we already have differently. If there is a
significant or material change in the way we handle your personal
information, we will notify you as detailed below.

What Do We Do With the Information We
Gather?

<div id="region-what-do-we-do-with-the-information-we-gather" class="accordion-content answer open" data-role="region" data-aria-labelledby="what-do-we-do-with-the-information-we-gather">

**A) We provide the Times Services.**

We use your information to help you use and navigate Times Services,
such as:

  - Making a Times Service available to you
  - Arranging access to your account
  - Providing customer service
  - Responding to your inquiries, requests, suggestions or complaints
  - Completing your payments and transactions
  - Sending service-related messages <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., a
    change in our terms and conditions)</span>
  - Saving your reading list, recipes or property searches
  - Displaying your Crossword stats
  - Letting you take part in paid services, polls, promotions, surveys,
    panels, research and comments.

**B) We Personalize Your Experience.**

We track your interests and reading habits
<span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., the articles you read)</span> to
personalize your reading experience using technology like algorithmic
recommendations and machine learning. This is how we highlight articles
you might be interested in and de-emphasize articles you’ve already
read. For more information about content personalization on Times
Services, you can read the [Personalization
F.A.Q.](https://help.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/hc/en-us/articles/360003965994-Personalization)
We also show you prices, promotions, products or services we believe
you’ll find interesting, based on demographic and usage data.

**C) We Allow You to Share User-Generated Content.**

Any information you disclose in your content becomes public — along with
your chosen screen name and uploaded photo.

**D) We Develop Products and Services, and Do Analysis.**

We analyze data on our users’ subscription, purchase and usage
behaviors. This helps us make business and marketing decisions.

For example, our analysis lets us predict preferences and price points
for our products and services. It helps us determine whether our
marketing is successful. It also shows us characteristics about our
readers, which we sometimes share in aggregate with advertisers.

Google Analytics is one of the analytics providers we use. You can find
out [how Google Analytics uses
data](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) and [how
to opt out of Google
Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**E) We Carry Out Administrative Tasks.**

  - For auditing: We verify that our internal processes work as intended
    and comply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements.
  - For fraud and security monitoring: We detect and prevent
    cyberattacks or unauthorized robot activities.
  - For customer satisfaction: We assess users’ satisfaction with Times
    Services and our customer care team.

The above activities can involve outside companies, agents or
contractors (“service providers”) with whom we share your personal
information for these purposes (discussed further below).

**F) We Offer Sweepstakes, Contests and Other Promotions.**

You can take part in our sweepstakes, contests and other promotions.
Some might have additional rules about how we use and disclose your
personal information.

**G) We Allow for Personalized Advertising on Times Services and Create
Audiences for Third Party Advertisers.**

We gather data and work with [third parties](/privacy/third-party) to
show you personalized ads. This data comes from ad tracking technologies
set by us or the third party <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g.,
cookies)</span>, the information you provide
<span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., your email address)</span>, your use of
Times Services <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., your reading
history)</span>, information from advertisers or advertising vendors
<span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., demographic data)</span> and anything
inferred from any of this information. We only use or share this
information in a manner that does not reveal your identity.

For example, we use Google to serve ads on Times Services. Google uses
cookies or unique device identifiers, in combination with their own
data, to show you ads based on you visiting NYTimes.com and other sites.
You can opt out of the use of the Google cookie by visiting the [related
Google privacy
policy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en).

We also create specific audiences that allow us to serve you
personalized advertising on our sites and apps, on behalf of
advertisers. To do this, we combine information we collect through
surveys (from subscribers, registered users and non-registered visitors)
with information we collect automatically using tracking technologies as
you use the Times Services. This combined information is used to build
models for measuring users against demographic and interest-based
attributes. With the help of service providers, these measurements are
then transformed into pools of users grouped by common attributes. Each
group is associated with a random ID that is then passed to our ad
server for us in targeting advertising campaigns on Times Services.

Another example is our affiliate link vendors, which we use in our
guides and product recommendations. Times Services include links that
will send you to affiliate vendor URLs and other services not operated
or controlled by us. These affiliate vendors use cookies and other
technologies to collect information about your navigation from the Times
Services to the merchant you are visiting. If you buy a product after
following a link to an affiliate link vendor’s URL, we may earn a
commission.

**Additional notes:**

  - For more about targeted advertising, and how to opt out with your
    specific browser and device, go to the [DAA Webchoices Browser
    Check](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) and [NAI Opt Out of
    Interest-Based
    Advertising](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1). You can
    [download the AppChoices app](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices)
    to opt out in mobile apps. You can also follow the instructions in
    the [“What Are Your Rights?”](#anchor-question4) section below.
  - We try to limit how our third-party advertising technology vendors
    use the information they gather from you. Many of these providers
    require us to enter into contracts that allow them to optimize their
    own services and products, or that help them create their own.  
      
    Essentially, these providers combine any information they gather
    about you through Times Services with information they receive from
    their other clients. This helps them target ads to you on behalf of
    their other clients, not just us.
  - These third parties sometimes use other services in order to serve
    ads; check [their privacy policies for more
    details](/privacy/third-party). For further information on tracking
    technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, see the
    applicable [Cookie
    Policy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/subscription/dg-cookie-policy/cookie-policy.html).

**H) We Advertise Times Services to You.**

We market our properties to you. Sometimes we use marketing vendors to
do this.

We serve ads through websites, locations, platforms and services
operated and owned by third parties. Often these ads are targeted at
people who have visited or registered for a Times Service but have not
subscribed or purchased anything. The ads are also targeted at people
with similar traits or behaviors to our subscribers or customers.

We target our advertising to these users by uploading an encrypted
customer list to a third party, or by incorporating a tracking
technology from a third party onto our Times Service. The third party
then matches individuals who appear in both our data and their data.
Because of how this matching process works, the third party can’t read
our encrypted customer list if they don’t already have it.

To opt out of receiving these matched ads, contact the applicable [third
parties](/privacy/third-party). For example, when we use “Custom
Audience” to serve you our ad through Facebook, you should be able to
hover over the box in the right corner of that Facebook ad and opt out.
We are not responsible for any third party’s failure to comply with
opt-out requests.

We periodically send you targeted email newsletters or promotional
emails. For information on opting out of these emails, see [“What Are
Your Rights?”](#anchor-question4)

**I) We Aggregate (or De-identify) Personal Information Into Larger
Findings.**

Sometimes we aggregate or de-identify information so that it can no
longer identify you, under applicable laws. This helps us better
understand and represent our users, such as when we measure ad
performance, create advertising interest-based segments or compile
survey results. We can use and disclose this aggregated or de-identified
information for any purpose, unless an applicable law says otherwise.

<div id="region-with-whom-do-we-share-the-information-we-gather" class="accordion-content answer open" data-role="region" data-aria-labelledby="with-whom-do-we-share-the-information-we-gather">

**A) Within The New York Times Company:**

We share your information with our affiliates for the purposes listed
here. See [a list of our
affiliates](https://help.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/hc/en-us/articles/360004990014).

**B) With Service Providers:**

We work with service providers, as defined
[above](#anchor-question2-sectionE), to carry out certain tasks:

  - Processing your payments
  - Fulfilling your orders
  - Maintaining technology and related infrastructure
  - Offering you customer service
  - Serving and targeting ads
  - Measuring ad performance
  - Presenting surveys
  - Shipping you products and mailings
  - Distributing emails
  - List processing and analytics
  - Managing and analyzing research
  - Managing promotions

When performing these tasks, service providers often have access to your
personal information.

We sometimes allow them to use aggregated or de-identified information
for other purposes, in accordance with applicable laws

**C) With Other Third Parties:**

There are situations when we share your information with third parties
beyond our service providers. We never share your email address with
these third parties without your consent, except in encrypted form to
engage in the matched ads process described
[above](#anchor-question2-sectionH).

1.  If you’re a U.S. print subscriber, we may share your name and
    mailing address (among other information) with other reputable
    companies that want to market to you by mail.

2.  We share information about our live event and conference attendees
    <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., your name, your company or your job
    title)</span> with the event sponsors. In those cases we notify you
    when you provide us the information.

3.  We share information about participants in our sweepstakes, contests
    and similar promotions with the promotions’ sponsors. In those cases
    we notify you when you provide us the information.

4.  We process payments you make through Times Services with external
    services.
    
    There are two ways this can happen:
    
      - We collect your information and share it with the third-party
        service for processing.
      - The third-party service collects your information for
        processing.

5.  In the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture,
    assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of
    our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any
    bankruptcy or similar proceedings), we would have a legitimate
    interest in disclosing or transferring your information to a third
    party — such as an acquiring entity and its advisers.

6.  We can preserve or share personal information if the law requires us
    to do so. We can also preserve or share personal information if we
    believe it would be necessary to:
    
      - Comply with the law or with legal process
      - Protect and defend our rights and property
      - Protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Times Services
      - Protect the safety or property of our users or the general
        public <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., if you provide false
        information or attempt to pose as someone else, we could share
        your information to help investigations into your
        actions)</span>
      - Cooperate with government authorities, which could be outside
        your country of residence.

7.  We disclose public activities in our RSS feeds, APIs and other
    distribution formats. Your public activities could thus appear on
    other websites, blogs or feeds.

**A) How Do I Opt Out of Email, Phone, Mail and Push Notifications?**

The opt-out methods described below are limited to the email address,
phone or device used. They won’t affect subsequent subscriptions.

1.  **Email:**
    
    We offer a variety of commercial emails and email newsletters. You
    can unsubscribe from them by following the “unsubscribe”
    instructions near the bottom of the email. You can also email us at
    <privacy@NYTimes.com>.
    
    You can [manage your NYTimes.com newsletter
    preferences](https://myaccount.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/seg/settings).

2.  **Mail or Telephone Promotions:**
    
    You can ask us to unsubscribe from our mail or telephone
    solicitations. You can also ask us to not share your information
    with third parties for marketing purposes. To do so, email us at
    <privacy@NYTimes.com> with “Opt Out” in the subject line, and your
    account number and phone number in the body of the email.
    
    You can write to us at: <span class="css-1msjh1x">Customer Care,
    P.O. Box 8041, Davenport, IA 52808-8041 </span>— or, for
    International Edition customers, <span class="css-1msjh1x">The New
    York Times International Edition, Immeuble Le Lavoisier, 4, Place
    des Vosges, CS 10001, 92052 Paris La Défense Cedex, France</span>.
    Please include your account number and phone number in the body of
    the letter.

3.  **Push Notifications:**
    
    You can opt out any time by adjusting your device settings, or
    uninstalling our app.

4.  **Text Messages:**
    
    You can opt out of text alerts any time by replying “STOP,” or any
    alternative keyword we’ve shared with you.

We complete any opt-out request as quickly as we can. This opt-out
request won’t prohibit us from sending you important nonmarketing
notices.

**B) How Do You Access, Change, Delete, Update or Exercise Your Other
Rights in Relation to Your Personal Information?**  
In some parts of the world, you have the right to:

  - Access, modify, or delete the personal information we have about you
  - Receive an electronic copy of the personal information we have about
    you, for data portability
  - Restrict, or object to, how we process personal information about
    you
  - Not receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of your
    privacy rights.

You have the right to object to the processing of your personal
information based on our legitimate interest or that of a third party —
unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing
of, or the keeping of, your personal information for the establishment,
exercise or defense of legal claims.

If you’d like to exercise any of the above rights, contact us via [this
form](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/data-subject-request) or by
calling us at our toll-free number, 1-800-NYTIMES. In your request,
please be specific. State the information you want changed, whether
you’d like your information suppressed from our database or whether
there are limitations you’d like us to put on how we use your personal
information. Please use the email address linked to that personal
information — we only complete requests on the information linked to
your email address. To verify your identity, we will email the email
address you provide us, and which matches our records, and wait for your
response. In some instances we may also ask for additional information.
This is how we verify your identity before complying.

You can designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.
In order to do that, please provide the agent with written permission,
signed by you, authorizing the agent to submit the request on your
behalf. The agent must submit that written permission along with the
request. We will contact you to verify your identity — and the
authorized agent’s permission — before a response to the request is
sent.

We’ll respond to your request in a manner consistent with applicable
law.

We might need to keep certain information for recordkeeping purposes, or
to complete a transaction you began prior to requesting a change or
deletion <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., if you make a purchase or
enter a promotion, you might not be able to change or delete the
personal information provided until after the completion of the purchase
or promotion)</span>.

In some cases, your request doesn’t ensure complete removal of the
content or information <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., if another user
has reposted your content)</span>.

If you’d like, you can lodge a complaint with a data protection
authority. A [list of E.U. data protection
authorities](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080)
is available.

**C) How Do You Manage Your Digital and Home Delivery Accounts?**

You can update your account information and see [your transaction
history](https://myaccount.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion) (for [International
Edition print subscribers](https://customercare.inyt.com)). If you need
assistance, call our toll-free number, 1-800-NYTIMES. [Other local
numbers](https://subscribe.inyt.com/footer?requestAction=displayContactIht)
are available.

It works differently if you subscribed via Apple’s App Store or Google
Play. Register with us to access the Account area, and contact Apple or
Google for your transaction history.

We generally don’t want to gather any sensitive information about you.
This includes:

  - Your social security number
  - Your racial or ethnic origin
  - Your political opinions
  - Your religion or other beliefs
  - Your health, biometric or genetic characteristics
  - Any trade union membership
  - Any criminal background

There are rare situations when we request this information
<span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., a reader survey asks about your

<div id="region-how-long-do-you-retain-data" class="accordion-content answer open" data-role="region" data-aria-labelledby="how-long-do-you-retain-data">

It depends. We store your personal information for as long as needed, or
permitted, based on the reason why we obtained it (consistent with
applicable law). This means we might retain your personal information
even after you close your account with us.

When deciding how long to keep your information, we consider:

  - How long we’ve had a relationship with you or provided a Times
    Service to you
  - Whether we are subject to any legal obligations
    <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., any laws that require us to keep
    transaction records for a certain period of time before we can
    delete them)</span>
  - Whether we have taken any legal positions
    <span class="css-1msjh1x">(e.g., in connection with any statutes of
    limitation)</span>.

Rather than delete your data, we might de-identify it by removing
identifying details.

If you have reason to believe your interaction with us is no longer
secure, notify us immediately.

The New York Times Company is headquartered in the United States. If you
are located outside the United States, your information is collected in
your country and then transferred to the United States — or to another
country in which we (or our affiliates or service providers) operate.

If we transfer your data out of the European Economic Area (E.E.A.), we
implement at least one of the three following safeguards:

  - We transfer your information to countries that have been recognized
    by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data
    protection according to E.E.A. standards (see the [full list of
    these
    countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en)).
  - We use a service provider in the United States that is [Privacy
    Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome) certified.
  - We take steps to ensure that the recipient is bound by E.U. Standard
    Contractual Clauses to protect your personal data. You can see a
    [copy of these
    clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en).

In certain situations, the courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory
agencies or security authorities in those countries might be entitled to
access your personal information.

<div id="region-what-is-our-legal-basis" class="accordion-content answer open" data-role="region" data-aria-labelledby="what-is-our-legal-basis">

In some jurisdictions, like the European Union and the European Economic
Area, we only collect, use or share information about you when we have a
valid reason. This is called “lawful basis.” Specifically, this is one
of the following:

  - The consent you provide to us at the point of collection of your
    information

  - The performance of the contract we have with you

  - The compliance of a legal obligation to which we are subject or

  - The legitimate interests of The Times, a third party or yourself.
    “Legitimate interest” is a technical term under international
    laws, including the European Union General Data Protection
    Regulation. It means that there are good reasons for the processing
    of your personal information, and that we take measures to minimize
    the impact on your privacy rights and interests. “Legitimate
    interest” also refers to our use of your data in ways you would
    reasonably expect and that have a minimal privacy impact.
    
    We have a legitimate interest in gathering and processing personal
    information, for example: (1) to ensure that our networks and
    information are secure; (2) to administer and generally conduct
    business within The New York Times Company; (3) to prevent fraud;
    and (4) to conduct our marketing activities.
