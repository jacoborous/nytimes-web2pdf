Change is the only constant in New York, and each season brings a host
of new options for diners weary of the same old, same old. There are
bigger, better food halls to lure the lunch crowd, and breweries and
bars to tempt after work. Veteran chefs with solid reputations are
taking risks, while unproven out-of-towners are making their first go of
it in the city.

Among the most anticipated openings this season is a
French-Mediterranean restaurant that pays homage to the Church of Rock
`n' Roll; a fancy sit-down restaurant, owned by the company behind Dig
Inn; and a jewel box for Basque cuisine from an alumnus of Frenchette
and Alinea.
