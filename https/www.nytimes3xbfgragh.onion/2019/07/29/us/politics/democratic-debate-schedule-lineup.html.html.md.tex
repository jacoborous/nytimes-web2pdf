For half of the candidates, it may be their last chance to make an
impression on the national debate stage.

When 20
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/2020-election}{Democratic
presidential candidates} gather for
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/democratic-debates}{the
second round of debates} this Tuesday and Wednesday, about half of them
will do so with the understanding that it will probably be their last
time debating on the national stage this election cycle.

The two debates, \textbf{which will air on CNN from 8 p.m. until roughly
10:30 p.m. each night}, are expected to be more contentious than
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/28/us/politics/democratic-debates-presidential.html}{the
first set of debates in Miami last month}, when Senator Kamala Harris of
California and former Housing Secretary Julián Castro
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/27/us/politics/julian-castro-telemundo-debate.html}{won

things to watch for}} \emph{in Tuesday night's debate.{]}}

Short of a breakout moment that turbocharges their grass-roots
fund-raising and juices their support in public polling, half the field
is in danger of missing the Democratic National Committee's qualifying
threshold for the next round of debates, scheduled for September.

Officials involved in the campaigns and some of the candidates
themselves have foreshadowed testier exchanges this week, as 10
candidates take the stage each night knowing they are fighting for their
political lives.

\textbf{Wednesday's debate} will feature former Vice President Joseph R.
Biden Jr., under attack for his past positions on race-related issues,
standing between the two leading black candidates: Senators Kamala
Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey. Mr. Biden has

Candidates will appear in this order on the stage, from left to right.

\hypertarget{the-format}{%
\subsection{The format}\label{the-format}}

The debates will begin with 60-second opening statements, followed by
60-second responses to questions posed by CNN's moderators, Dana Bash,
Don Lemon and Jake Tapper.

CNN will not ask the candidates ``show of hands'' questions. And
representatives from the network have told the campaigns they will
penalize any candidate who ``consistently interrupts'' by reducing the
amount of time that candidate has to speak.

The candidates will appear at the Fox Theater in downtown Detroit, a
venue that hosted the infamous 2016 Republican presidential primary
debate in which
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/03/04/us/politics/republican-debate.html}{Donald
J. Trump defended the size of his manhood} after Senator Marco Rubio of
Florida attacked it.

\hypertarget{the-dynamics}{%
\subsection{The dynamics}\label{the-dynamics}}

On the first night, CNN's moderators will undoubtedly seek to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/30/us/politics/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren.html}{draw
distinctions between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren}. Others onstage will
also seek to contrast themselves with the race's leading progressives.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has, in recent interviews,
foreshadowed a resistance to the free college and Medicare for All
proposals pushed by Mr. Sanders. Former Gov. John Hickenlooper of
Colorado and former Representative John Delaney of Maryland oppose
socialism and have attacked Mr. Sanders, a democratic socialist, without
much success.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/30/us/politics/steve-bullock-debate.html}{Gov.
Steve Bullock of Montana}, who did not qualify for the first debate in
June, has said since then that
\href{https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/steve-bullock-providing-health-care-undocumented-immigrants/story?id=64250125}{he
would not support extending federal health care benefits} to
undocumented immigrants, separating himself from most of the
presidential field.

More prospective sources of tension might include a battle between Mayor
Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Representative Beto
O'Rourke of Texas --- a conflict Mr. O'Rourke's allies have foreshadowed
in recent days. Ms. Klobuchar, meanwhile, has barely hid her disdain for
Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. O'Rourke, two men who are younger and less
accomplished than her but have received far more attention in the race.
And Marianne Williamson, a self-help author,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/27/us/politics/marianne-williamson-mental-health.html}{remains
a wild card}.

While all 10 candidates debating on Tuesday are white, Wednesday's
debate will feature five people of color, including Ms. Harris and Mr.
Booker, who have each placed their bets on wresting the support of black
voters away from Mr. Biden.

There's little doubt Mr. Biden's record on race will be a focus. Ms.
Harris's broadside during the first debate against Mr. Biden's
decades-old position on mandatory busing to integrate public schools
energized her campaign, while Mr. Booker last week
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/23/us/politics/biden-criminal-justice.html}{hit
Mr. Biden for writing the 1994 crime bill}, previewing a line of attack.

Mr. Biden's advisers have said he will be more prepared to fight back
Wednesday than he had been in Miami. His aides
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/25/us/politics/biden-booker-black-voters.html}{pre-emptively
criticized Mr. Booker last week}, highlighting his tenure as the mayor
of Newark.

On the stage's edge, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington is expected to stress
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/24/us/politics/jay-inslee-climate-change.html}{his
signature issue, climate change}, while Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of
New York may return to a vague attack she launched last week in Iowa,
when she accused unnamed presidential rivals of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/26/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-2020.html}{not
wanting to see women working ``outside the home.''}

\hypertarget{the-stakes}{%
\subsection{The stakes}\label{the-stakes}}

For candidates like Mr. Inslee and Ms. Gillibrand, the stakes this week
are enormous. Their fund-raising pace is well behind what is necessary
to reach 130,000 donors by September, which candidates must amass to
qualify for the next round of debates.

Candidates must also receive at least 2 percent support in at least four
qualifying polls to participate in the debates, scheduled for Sept. 12
and Sept. 13 in Houston. If 10 or fewer candidates qualify, the debate
will take place on only one night.

Seven candidates have already locked down their spots: Mr. Biden, Ms.
Warren, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Harris, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. O'Rourke and, as of
Monday, Mr. Booker.

Mr. Castro and Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur, have enough donors to
qualify but need one more qualifying poll each. Ms. Klobuchar has
crossed the polling threshold and is on pace to reach the donor
threshold, according to her campaign, which said Monday that she had
nearly 120,000 donors and was averaging 1,000 new donors a day.

But no other candidate has met either benchmark for the September
debate, and none of them appear particularly close. Short of a breakout
moment that translates into a surge of support over the next month, this
week will be the last time they appear in a nationally televised debate
for this race.
