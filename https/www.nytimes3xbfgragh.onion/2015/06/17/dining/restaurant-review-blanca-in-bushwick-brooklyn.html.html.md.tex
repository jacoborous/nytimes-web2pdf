When Blanca opened in 2012, a 27-course tasting menu served at a counter
behind a pizzeria in Bushwick sounded like the setup to a joke. (Second
prize is 30 courses.) The restaurant does have its sense of humor, but
it quickly proved that about cooking for maximum pleasure, it was
unswervingly serious.

Carlo Mirarchi, the chef and an owner of
\href{http://www.blancanyc.com/}{Blanca} and its sprawling mother ship,
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/08/24/dining/reviews/robertas-nyc-restaurant-review.html}{Roberta's},
was a rigorous miniaturist, combining a few ingredients at a time into
two- or three-bite compositions that were utterly complete, even if they
left you wanting more. At 31, he already had an impressive sense of what
to put on a plate and what to leave off.

What he didn't have yet was a repertoire deep enough for the length of
the meals he served. My early dinners at Blanca were marked by dishes
that seemed like placeholders, and there were moments when the kitchen's
reach exceeded its technical grasp. It was as if Mr. Mirarchi were
giving you a tour of a mansion he'd bought before the contractor had
finished the punch list. Most of the place was spectacular, but there
were rooms where you would not want to spend the night.

Being a critic, I had a suggestion, hinted at in
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/10/17/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-blanca-in-bushwick.html}{my
two-star review} that year: make the meal shorter and cheaper. Being a
chef, Mr. Mirarchi ignored me and kept refining his marathon tastings,
very gradually.

``The menu changes so slowly that for us it's like watching your hair
grow,'' Leslie Vinyard, Blanca's welcoming and gracious service captain,
remarked one night from behind the countertop. So it may have taken a
while, but every time I've settled into one of the padded brown-leather
captain's chairs recently, nearly everything I've tasted has been
remarkable in one way or another.

One dinner this spring got rolling with a fat little Pacific Northwest
oyster. Sharing its deep cup-shaped shell were juicy round cells of
finger lime that popped in my mouth like citrus caviar, and a pool of
green juice pressed from roasted asparagus, an ingenious combination
that teased a mild cucumber flavor out of the oyster.

At the end of the night, asparagus came back. Samantha Short, the pastry
chef, had made a sort of coconut semifreddo, silky on the tongue, which
hovered over a spoonful or two of white asparagus soup seasoned with
sugar and salt. Sweet and savory, tropical and vegetal flavors crashed
together and bloomed into something daring and great. The desserts after
some mega-tastings are gradual diminuendos. This was a mike drop.

Over three meals since October, I've experienced all sorts of flavor
detonations: a streaky fold of raw pancetta with a burst of black
peppercorns; a salt-roasted Japanese sweet potato with an unexpectedly
dreamy dressing of macadamia milk and ground espresso beans; a crunchy
wedge of tart apple carrying a small, remarkable payload of garlic,
olive oil, anchovies, fried bread crumbs and cardoons cooked in apple
juice.

I have also started looking forward to sunchokes, a vegetable that has a
hard time getting more out of me than grudging acceptance. Blanca
caramelized them deeply, steeped them in soy milk, then whipped them
into a cream. A ragged leaf of toasted sea lettuce supplied a bottom
note, and the crumb of beeswax and honey at the bottom of the dish made
my eyes go wide, every time.

Then there are the agnolotti parcels that are like Freshen Up gum from
the dark side. They burst when you bite down with an oozing, inky-green
liquid made from melted taleggio and phytoplankton. The flavor is like a
distillation of spinach, seaweed and squid ink. It's a totally
disorienting sensation, and while I love it, not everyone will. I think
of this course as the one guest-directed by David Lynch. It is when the
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb9Acr_OHCw}{dwarf starts to
dance}.

One of Mr. Mirarchi's sillier conceits in the early days was making you
wait more than two hours for an ordinary slice of filone, presented as
its own course. You still wait, but now it's worth it. The breads made
by Nina Subhas may include a soft Hawaiian sweet roll with pineapple
juice in the dough and black salt on top, and a flaky garlic knot that's
like a savory Danish. Or you may be given a chunk torn from a squat
round loaf made from Roberta's pizza dough. Brushed with olive oil, this
steaming-hot pizza bread doesn't need the house-made butter, not that I
let that stop me.

Once, grilled snow crabs were served with a deliciously funky
crab-innards sauce. Now the steamed legs of very recently living king
crabs come with a saffron-colored slosh of melted butter sauce whipped
with shaved bottarga. The sauce is an upgrade, less likely to step on
the sweetness of the shellfish, and I've never again been served
gelatinous, half-raw crab legs as I was in 2012. This has become one of
New York's essential dishes, along with the 'nduja raviolo, an explosion
of spicy pork lava, the one item that has been on the lineup since
opening night.

Mr. Mirarchi's notion of what al dente means seems to have softened. So
has the pasta, slightly, but I'll deal with the extra-chewy core of
tightly hand-rolled noodles to taste his creamy, yolk-rich carbonara
with lamb fat and cured lamb breast.

Beneath the body of Blanca's menu is an Italian chassis, so after pasta
come the meat courses. There may be a few rosy slices of roast duck
placed beside a slow-burning beet mole, followed by porchetta with
chimichurri. The servings are never very large and never as hot as I'd
like, but the meat is always juicier and more concentrated than almost
any other restaurant can manage.

When you say ``savory desserts,'' some people look for the exits. None
of these people have tasted Ms. Short's intermezzos and finales. She can
make the heat and the vegetal taste of poblano peppers seem like
sensible, delicious additions to a cake. One night, her parting shot was
a chocolate-Parmesan ice cream with shaved white truffles. It was
another mike drop.

One could, and come to think of it one will, complain that Blanca offers
no wine bottles under \$80 and no glasses under \$18. Customers who have
torn a hole in their budget to afford the \$195 for dinner, before tax
and tip, shouldn't have to drink beer all night. Not that this would be
a terrible fate; Blanca's beers are as varied and full of character as
the sakes and wines. A course-by-course wine pairing can be had for
\$95, but Shanti Carson, the sommelier, excels at working with people
who aren't that thirsty.

Ms. Carson is also the one who placed the vinyl on the turntable when I
decided to prove to the other 11 people at the counter that
``\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyq0Sk-I0Ck}{New York Groove}''
isn't the only good song on Ace Frehley's first solo album.

The record collection, which Mr. Mirarchi may well have lifted straight
from the garage of his childhood home, is one of the ways Blanca
deflates high-end dining's gassier pretensions. His aim has always been
to run a restaurant that is both a luxury and a weird adventure. The
entrance tells you everything. You walk into a cinder-block bomb shelter
of a pizzeria, past the crowds eating pies with names like Lamb of God.
You turn left at the bar, go out the door, take another left at the
radio studio and a right at the tiki bar. Keep going past the shipping
containers and the outdoor oven, walk down a couple of steps, through
the door, and you're inside Bushwick's first three-star restaurant.
