Work will be suspended at two NASA centers, a setback that could end
hopes for sending astronauts back to the moon in 2024.

The coronavirus pandemic on Earth is knocking
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/science/moon-robot-rover-viper-nasa.html}{NASA's
moon} plans off course.

On Thursday evening, Jim Bridenstine, the space agency's administrator,
announced the suspension of the manufacture and testing of the Space
Launch System and Orion, the giant rocket and crew capsule that would be
used to take astronauts back to the moon.

The Trump administration had
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/22/science/trump-moon-nasa.html}{set
a goal of the next moon landing occurring by the end of 2024}. With the
spread of the coronavirus, however, NASA is now shutting down work at
the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, where the rocket is being
built, and the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, about 45 miles to
the northeast of Michoud. The first Space Launch System booster is being
tested at Stennis.

There has been one confirmed case of the coronavirus among Stennis
employees. There are no confirmed cases at Michoud, but the number of
infected people in the New Orleans area has risen quickly in the past
few days.

The directive from Mr. Bridenstine is for workers at the two NASA sites
to work remotely, but there is no way to build or test a rocket without
people at the sites. The change takes effect on Friday.

``The NASA and contractors teams will complete an orderly shutdown that
puts all hardware in a safe condition until work can resume,'' Mr.
Bridenstine said in a news release. A minimal team will remain after the
shutdown, only for security and to maintain critical infrastructure.

Development of the Space Launch System --- a modern equivalent of the
powerful Saturn 5 that took the Apollo astronauts to the moon --- has
been delayed for years, and the price tag has risen by billions of
dollars. The first launch, a test flight without any astronauts aboard,
was already not scheduled to occur before 2021. Now even that target may
be too optimistic if work at Michoud and Stennis is suspended for an
extended period.

``We realize there will be impacts to NASA missions,'' Mr. Bridenstine
said, ``but as our teams work to analyze the full picture and reduce
risks we understand that our top priority is the health and safety of
the NASA workforce.''

There have also been confirmed coronavirus cases at two other NASA
centers: the Ames Research Center in California and the Marshall Space
Flight Center in Alabama. NASA has been encouraging employees to work
from home if possible.

The spread of the coronavirus could also jeopardize NASA's science
missions including
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/22/science/nasa-webb-space-telescope-hubble.html}{the
James Webb Space Telescope}, a successor to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2015/04/23/science/space/unforgettable-hubble-space-telescope-photos.html}{the
Hubble Space Telescope} that is scheduled to launch in March 2021
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/27/science/webb-telescope-nasa.html}{after
years of delays}.

During a virtual town hall on Friday that was broadcast over the
internet, NASA officials told planetary scientists that the pandemic has
slowed some work.

``Many people have asked us about James Webb,'' said Thomas H.
Zurbuchen, the associate administrator for NASA's science mission
directorate. ``And of course, it will be impacted, even though it is one
of our top priorities.''

Because of restrictions for travel of people needed to complete testing
and preparation of the spacecraft, ``It is anticipated by early April,
the Webb project could be experiencing a day-for-day schedule impact to
its critical path as an increased number of activities come to a halt,''
Dr. Zurbuchen said.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/05/science/mars-2020-rover-name.html}{Perseverance
rover}, which is to head to Mars this summer, could also be affected.
That spacecraft is at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which has not
yet been shut down.

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

Because of the orbital paths of Mars and Earth, the launch must occur in
a window in July or August, or it would have to be delayed until 2022
when the two planets again line up.

``Teams are doing, frankly, heroes' work to keep us on track for a July
launch,'' Dr. Zurbuchen said.

Another Mars mission, ExoMars, a collaboration between Russia and the
European Space Agency, has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/12/science/mars-rover-coronavirus.html}{already
been pushed back to 2022 from 2020}, mostly because of technical
problems that cannot be solved by July. Officials also acknowledged that
the travel restrictions because of the coronavirus pandemic would have
made the work even more challenging to complete.

More optimistically, NASA announced Wednesday that
\href{https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-spacex-invite-media-to-first-crew-launch-to-station-from-america-since-2011}{it
was aiming to launch astronauts} to the International Space Station
before the end of May.

The two astronauts would fly aboard Crew Dragon, a capsule built by
SpaceX, the rocket company founded by Elon Musk, and would be the first
crewed mission to lift off from the United States since the space
shuttles were retired in 2011. Since then, NASA has been relying on
Russia to provide transportation for its astronauts.
