``I'm okay. Don't tell Mom and Dad. They'll worry,'' he wrote to his
sister. He may be the first nurse in New York City to die from the
coronavirus.

Kious Kelly, a nurse manager at a Manhattan hospital, texted his sister
on March 18 with some devastating news: He had tested positive for the
coronavirus and was on a ventilator in the intensive care unit. He told
her he could text but not talk.

``I'm okay. Don't tell Mom and Dad. They'll worry,'' he wrote to his
sister, Marya Patrice Sherron.

That was his last message. Ms. Sherron's subsequent texts to him went
unanswered. In less than a week, he was dead.

Mr. Kelly, a 48-year-old assistant nurse manager at Mount Sinai West,
may have been the first New York City nurse to die from the virus.

His sister said he had asthma but was otherwise well.

``His death could have been prevented,''
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/marya.patrice.5}{Ms. Sherron
said on Facebook} Wednesday. Later, she added: ``I'm angry. He was
healthy.''

Colleagues at the hospital were angry, too. Some complained on social
media channels that they did not have an adequate supply of protective
clothing or masks.

A nurse who worked with Mr. Kelly said the hospital had offered nurses
one plastic protective gown for an entire shift, though normal protocol
required a change of gowns between interactions with infected patients.
The nurse, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the staff member
was not authorized to speak to the media, said Mr. Kelly had not used
protective equipment, even though he regularly helped nurses on his team
with hands-on care.

As recently as March 10, he helped a nurse take off her protective gear
after working with a patient who tested positive for the virus, the
nurse said.

Several Mount Sinai West staff members, contacted for this story, said
they had been told by hospital administrators not to speak to
journalists. Mr. Kelly's death was first reported
\href{https://nypost.com/2020/03/25/worker-at-nyc-hospital-where-nurses-wear-trash-bags-as-protection-dies-from-coronavirus/}{in
The New York Post}.

Gia Lisa Krahne, an outside consultant who provided alternative
Ayurvedic care to a patient at Mount Sinai West, said she last saw Mr.
Kelly at work the week of March 9, interacting with patients and
hospital staff, wearing neither a mask nor any protective gear.

\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/bevin.watters?fref=profile_friend_list\&hc_location=friends_tab}{Bevon
Bloise, a registered nurse at Mount Sinai West,} complained on Facebook
that the hospital does not have sufficient personal protective
equipment, or P.P.E. ``I'm also very angry with the Mount Sinai Health
System for not protecting him. We do not have enough PPE, we do not have
the correct PPE, and we do not have the appropriate staffing to handle
this pandemic. And I do not appreciate representatives of this health
system saying otherwise on the news.''

``We lost a great fighter during this war,'' a co-worker named

Torres said on Facebook.} She posted a photo of co-workers tying
bandannas over their faces in an effort to protect themselves. ``NO THIS
IS NOT PROPER PPE,'' she wrote.

On its Facebook page, Mount Sinai West said it was ``deeply saddened by
the passing of a beloved member of our nursing staff,'' without naming
Mr. Kelly.

In an email, a hospital spokeswoman, Lucia Lee, disputed the claim that
the hospital had not furnished protective equipment to its staff. ``This
crisis is straining the resources of all New York area hospitals, and
while we do --- and have had --- enough protective equipment for our
staff, we will all need more in the weeks ahead,'' Ms. Lee said in the
statement.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

The New York Post article included a photo of hospital staff wearing
garbage bags over what appeared to be scrubs. Two nurses, who spoke on
condition of anonymity for fear of being fired, said they were
disposable scrubs made of permeable material, which is why nurses
wrapped plastic garbage bags around them.

The photo, they said, was taken on March 17, at a time when there were
many coronavirus patients at the hospital and others who had yet to be
tested but who presented symptoms of infection.

In the emailed statement, Ms. Lee added that ``the troubling photo
circulating in the media specifically shows the nurses in proper P.P.E.
underneath garbage bags.''

She did not respond to a question asking why hospital staff wore garbage
bags.

Mr. Kelly lived a few blocks away from the hospital and was described by
colleagues as a dedicated, good-humored colleague.

``He used to carry around a thick notepad holder that hides a box full
of chocolates and candies so he can have it handy to give out to
miserable/ grumbly nurses and doctors who are more likely than not
`hangry,'''
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/joanne.loo.9}{Joanne Loo, a
nurse at Mount Sinai West, posted on Facebook}on Wednesday.

But nursing was not his first vocation. A native of Lansing, Michigan,
Mr. Kelly moved to New York more than 20 years ago to pursue a career as
a dancer, his sister said. He then went to nursing school and worked as
a nurse at Mount Sinai West, before being promoted to the post of
assistant manager in the telemetry department.

His family is now trying to bring his body back to Michigan.

``We know we can't have a service anytime soon, but we want him home,''
Ms. Sherron said. ``He died alone. We want him home now.''
