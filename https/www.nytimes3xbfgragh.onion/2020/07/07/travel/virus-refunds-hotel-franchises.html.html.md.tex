Here we are, wondering aloud about the oversight capabilities of hotel
franchises, and what powers they can exert over their thousands of
individual owners. Thanks Covid-19.

My wife and I were supposed to attend a wedding in Sonoma this spring,
but the affair was obviously canceled. I canceled our Best Western
reservation well before the 24 hours required by the company's new
coronavirus
\href{https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/notice/covid-19-response-cancel-policy.html}{cancellation
policy}, but was told that the only option is to postpone our stay for a
year --- as if I jet-set out to wine country every year for a wedding
(and besides, I'm more of a beer guy). I've been messaging back and
forth with Best Western on Facebook; the customer-service people said
the hitch lies with the hotel owner, who is refusing to issue the
refund. What's the point of flexible corporate cancellation policies if
individual hotels aren't required to adhere to them? George

The pandemic has brought to light some nerdy issues about the travel
industry --- ones that most of us never needed to think about before.
But here we are, wondering aloud about the oversight capabilities of
hotel franchises, and what powers they can exert over their thousands of
individual owners.

I got several emails about this topic. Nick, another reader, faced a
nearly identical uphill battle while trying to cancel a June reservation
at the Hilton Rome Airport. Hilton's
\href{https://help.hilton.com/s/article/Change-cancellation-policy-extended-to-August-31}{stated
policies} for refunds are flexible, yet the individual hotel owner
refuses to budge.

For starters, the answer is yes: Whenever a company like Best Western or
Hilton announces a flexible corporate cancellation policy, it's meant to
apply to all branded hotels. But Best Western also
\href{https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/notice/covid-19-response-cancel-policy.html}{states
outright} that a small percentage of individual owners may be eligible
to deny refunds on a small percentage of bookings. And that's what
happened here.

A spokeswoman for Best Western said in a statement that ``During the
COVID-19 pandemic, Best Western Hotels \& Resorts has offered a flexible
cancellation policy to its valued guests. This policy includes that `a
more restrictive cancellation policy may apply to a limited number of
high-demand dates at individual hotels,' which was applicable to this
guest's reservation.''

After reaching out to Hilton, I learned that Nick got trapped by an even
more peculiar loophole --- a bizarre wrench in the pandemic's
ever-expanding toolbox of bizarre wrenches. On March 17, Italy passed
the ``Cura Italia'' decree, a relief measure meant to offset the
economic toll of the pandemic in one of the hardest-hit countries. The
new law gave hotel owners in Italy the option to make the call on
whether to issue refunds or vouchers.

As I've reported before, cash-strapped travel companies have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/12/travel/refunds-or-credits-travelers-and-businesses-face-off.html}{numerous
reasons for retaining non-refundable payments} in the age of the
coronavirus, and it's also not hard to understand why the owner of hotel
in Italy --- at an airport, no less --- would choose that option,
especially when expressly given the greenlight by the Italian
government. Another reader bemoaned a similar issue, also with an
Italian hotel. ``Why is an American who never set foot on Italian soil
subject to a new Italian decree?'' she wondered.

In general, though, hotels have generally been better about
Covid-related cash refunds than airlines, tour operators and cruise
lines. In mid-March, as the world started shutting down, every major
hotel company announced newly flexible cancellation terms, even for
``non-refundable'' or ``advance purchase'' reservations. And even now,
as we move into summer, hotel policies remain pretty flexible. Hilton,
for example, allows guests to cancel any reservation booked through
August without penalty, so long as it's done so at least 24 hours before
the arrival date. It's a strategic move meant to get people to take a
leap, plan travel, book trips.

Hilton's communications department has worked its magic --- a
spokeswoman for the brand has confirmed that Nick's refund is in
process. And in a followup email, you told me that Best Western's
Facebook customer-service team has offered you a gift card, which,
unlike a rebooked stay, can be used at any of the company's hotels.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

I realize it's not quite the same as a cash refund, but amid an era when
planning (and canceling) travel feels especially difficult and
impersonal, measures like these can feel like a welcome human touch.
Whatever you're drinking --- be it beer or wine --- I'll say cheers to
that.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/25/travel/coronavirus-refunds-overseas-adventure-travel.html}{\emph{May

Boston-based tour operator, drew hundreds of reader responses. One, from
a woman named Lisa, stuck with me: ``I love to travel and am very aware
that many travel services companies are fighting for their lives,'' she
wrote. ``But as a customer, I am increasingly concerned about
shouldering the bankruptcy risk of the tour operator. If they go
bankrupt, those vouchers are worthless. It's a real dilemma, how to be
supportive of travel companies yet not end up losing thousands.''}
