In a bid to salvage the summer tourist season, travelers from France,
Italy, Spain and dozens of other nations no longer have to isolate for
14 days after arriving.

LONDON --- England will drop its mandatory 14-day quarantine for
visitors from more than 50 countries but leave the restrictions in place
for travelers coming from the United States, deepening the isolation of
America and delivering another rebuke to President Trump for his
handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

The European Union recently
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/world/europe/eu-reopening-blocks-us-travelers.html}{upheld
a ban on travelers from the United States}, even as it opened its
borders to visitors from Canada, Rwanda, Thailand and 15 other
countries. England's policy, announced on Friday, is not as draconian.
Visitors from America can still enter the country so long as they agree
to isolate themselves for two weeks.

But those from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jul/03/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-warn-public-pubs-reopen-england-saturday?page=with:block-5eff3c7b8f08ff51fe2ac38a\#block-5eff3c7b8f08ff51fe2ac38a}{dozens
of other countries} will be able to travel to England with no
restrictions --- an arrangement intended to bolster the languishing
tourism industry in time for the summer vacation season. The regulations
will take effect on July 10.

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland apply their own travel policies and
may not follow England's lead in easing restrictions.

The United States has barred most visitors from Britain since March,
after briefly exempting them from a travel ban on the European Union. At
the time, Europe was dealing with far more coronavirus infections than
the United States. Since then, the epicenter of the pandemic has moved
across the Atlantic.

During the initial phase of the outbreak, Britain stayed open to travel
from viral hot spots like Italy, Spain and Iran. By the time it
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/world/europe/uk-quarantine-johnson.html}{imposed
the quarantine measures}, its infection rates were among the highest in
the world.

That prompted fierce criticism of a policy that placed restrictions on
people arriving from countries where the virus was well under control,
including New Zealand. The authorities threatened to fine rule breakers
up to £1,000 (\$1,245).

Critics said the measures were economically damaging, ineffective and
legally unenforceable because the country did not have the resources to
ensure that people were obeying their 14-day quarantine. Of the 12
police forces that replied to questions from the BBC, none said they had
handed out any fines.

Some public-health experts said the fractious debate over the quarantine
had distracted from more pressing problems, like safely reopening
Britain's schools, organizing an effective test-and-trace program and
organizing a system to stamp out new outbreaks in
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/01/leicester-outbreak-driven-by-infection-rise-in-under-19s-says-phe-report}{cities
like Leicester} to avert a second lockdown.

``The U.K. government seems focused on giving people a summer pandemic
holiday instead of dealing with the hard issues facing the aviation
industry for the coming year,'' said Professor Devi Sridhar, the
director of the global health governance program at the University of
Edinburgh.

Scotland has balked at the easing, much as it resisted Prime Minister
Boris Johnson's earlier plans to lift the lockdown. Its infection and
death rates are lower than in England, which officials attribute to its
more cautious approach. The Scottish government has yet to decide how to
relax restrictions on travelers, though its options are somewhat
limited, given its open border with England.

Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told the BBC on Friday that the
United States would be excluded from the immediate relaxation because of
the ``very high numbers of infections'' in the country.

The government has designated countries with green, yellow and red
lights, based on ``the prevalence of coronavirus, the numbers of new
cases and potential trajectory of the disease in that destination.'' The
United States
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage}{has
a red light.}

The announcement appeared to go further than an earlier idea floated by
ministers to create ``air bridges'' with specific countries, in which
travelers would have reciprocal freedom to travel. The government still
hopes that a number of the exempted countries will not require visitors
from Britain to quarantine.

But the list of greenlight countries comprises more than 50~--- among
them Vietnam and Hong Kong, though not mainland China. Some could still
require travelers from Britain to quarantine on arrival. On the British
end, many arriving passengers will still be required to provide contact
information.

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the

    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

Still, for the travel industry, it was a welcome relief after a tense
period when they worried that the summer season was going to be ruined.
Many complained about the damage to their businesses and warned about
job losses.

``It has been an incredibly frustrating time,'' said Steven Freudmann,
the chairman of the Institute of Travel and Tourism, a lobbying group.
``There just appears to be no coordinated thinking. A shambles is the
only word I can think of.''

Mr. Freudmann said he was ``happy and relieved that finally --- finally
--- the government seems to be making sensible decisions.'' But he said
the government's erratic policies had ``created a lack of confidence and
clearly we, as an industry, have a job in establishing that
confidence.''

Horto, Greece, on Thursday.Credit...Magnesianews.gr, via Associated
Press

Nor was Mr. Freudmann the only critic of the government's
decision-making over quarantine rules.

The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, described it as
``shambolic,'' adding that she wanted to study the detail before taking
any decision on whether Scotland should adopt the new program with
England.

Among those who flouted the existing travel restrictions was the father
of Mr. Johnson, Stanley Johnson. The elder Mr. Johnson, 79, posted
pictures on social media of his arrival in Greece, which currently
prevents vacationers from flying directly from Britain. He apparently
got there via the Bulgarian capital, Sofia.

It was not the first time he had defied government coronavirus advice.
Before Britain's lockdown began, when the prime minister urged Britons
not to go to the pub, his father said he would go anyway if he felt the
thirst.

Speaking from Greece, Stanley Johnson told the Daily Mail newspaper that
he was in the country on ``essential business, trying to Covid-proof my
property in view of the upcoming letting season.''
