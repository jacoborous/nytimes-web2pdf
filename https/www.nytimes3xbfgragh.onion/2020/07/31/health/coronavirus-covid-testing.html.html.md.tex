One?}\label{covid-19-tests-are-in-short-supply-should-you-still-get-one}}

Public health officials once suggested only people with symptoms should
be tested. Now some say getting one is a civic duty.

First, health officials said
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/21/coronavirus-testing-strategyshift/}{you
should not get tested} for the coronavirus unless you had symptoms. Then
the message shifted:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/health/coronavirus-pooled-testing.html}{Mass
testing was essential} to trace and contain the pandemic.

Now there is more confusion as
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/health/coronavirus-testing-supply-shortage.html}{public
health officials warn} of shortages of testing supplies, soaring demand
and long wait times for results, which have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/health/covid-contact-tracing-tests.html}{thwarted
contact-tracing efforts in places with heavy outbreaks}. At the same
time, politicians in states where cases had fallen have urged people to
get tested, whether they have symptoms or not.

``Go get a
test,''\href{https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-photos-audio-rush-transcript-governor-cuomo-announces-phase-three-indoor-dining-postponed\#}{Gov.
Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said this month}. ``It doesn't cost you
anything. It doesn't hurt.''

And in New Jersey,
\href{https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200623b.shtml}{Gov.
Philip D. Murphy said during} a recent
briefing\href{https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200623b.shtml}{on
the coronavirus}: ``Getting tested gives you peace of mind that you are
not unknowingly carrying this virus and can spread it among your family
and friends. We just need you to go out and get tested.''

What is a conscientious person who already wears a mask and maintains
social distance to do?

\hypertarget{is-there-a-moral-obligation-to-get-a-test}{%
\subsection{Is there a moral obligation to get a
test?}\label{is-there-a-moral-obligation-to-get-a-test}}

Yes, said \href{https://law.wisc.edu/profiles/racharo}{R. Alta Charo}, a
professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

``One of the most important things to keep in mind when discussing
public health is the fact that this is fundamentally a community issue,
not merely an individual health concern,'' she said. ``We are all in
this together. What I do affects everyone around me, and what they do
affects me.''

If public health experts want people to be tested, they should comply,
especially if the goal is to gather critical information about how many
people are infected at a given point, Professor Charo said.

Epidemiologists can use the data to determine how fast the virus is
spreading and which measures are working, she said.

Taking a test, like wearing a mask, shows ``a desire to be a part of the
solution,'' said Dr.
\href{https://www.adelphi.edu/faculty/profiles/profile.php?PID=0328}{K.
C. Rondello}, an epidemiologist at Adelphi University in Garden City,
N.Y.

The virus has been difficult to control in large part because many
infected people without symptoms have unknowingly spread it, he said.

More testing will help identify these hidden cases, Dr. Rondello said.

But
\href{https://www.du.edu/ahss/philosophy/faculty_staff/upton_candace.html}{Candace
L. Upton}, a professor of philosophy at the University of Denver, said
people should not feel duty bound to get a test. It can even be argued
that it is morally wrong to go in for a test if you have no symptoms and
are not at a high risk, she said.

``Until there is no longer a shortage of test kits, it is morally
unjustified to test patients for Covid-19 solely for the purpose of
collecting data,'' Professor Upton said. ``Because of the deficit, labs
shouldn't be offering them to people who are just curious.''

The priority should remain testing only those with symptoms or
compromised immune systems, and essential workers and older people, she
said.

Professor Upton added that testing should be done selectively even in
locations where tests are readily available and where results can be
delivered quickly.

``The whole system is unfair,'' she said. ``And so to take advantage of
surpluses in certain places in the market is to add to the injustice to
people who didn't have availability in the first place.''

The national failure to coordinate testing efforts shouldn't cause
people with no symptoms to feel conflicted about being tested for the
coronavirus, said Dr.
\href{https://www.onemedical.com/providers/andrew-diamond/}{Andrew
Diamond}, chief medical officer at One Medical in San Francisco, a
membership-based primary care practice with offices around the country.

``If there is a way for you to get tested that does not clearly and
directly impair someone who is a priority, then you should get tested
for sure,'' he said.

Molly Wallace, 24, who grew up on Martha's Vineyard, was tested after
she moved back to the island from Boston in March.

She was furloughed from her job as a medical assistant and began
volunteering at a testing site, Test MV, at Martha's Vineyard Regional
High School, where she went to school.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

Ms. Wallace said that she had never had coronavirus symptoms but that
she had still felt obligated to be tested. ``I don't want to be the
person to bring Covid here,'' she said.

All residents and visitors to the island are encouraged to be tested at
Test MV, where volunteers distribute free kits of self-administered
nasal swabs, said Ms. Wallace, who is now the site's outreach
coordinator.

During her interview last week, Ms. Wallace said that people typically
got their results within 72 hours, or more quickly if they test positive
for the virus. At the time, Martha's Vineyard stood in stark contrast to
states like New York and Arizona, where lines for tests have sometimes
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/us/coronavirus-test-shortage.html}{stretched
around blocks} and
\href{https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/07/06/slow-covid-19-test-results-have-cascade-effect-public-health/5386582002/}{the
turnaround time} for results has been days, if not weeks.

On Friday, she said the turnaround time for tests was now around seven
days, because of the shortage.

\subsection{Don't feel guilty if you don't want to get a

Wearing a mask should feel obligatory, Dr. Diamond said, but taking a
test should not.

If tests were widely available and turnaround times for results were
much faster, people would have a stronger sense of obligation to get
tested, he said.

``Under the current circumstance, I would say it's much more important
to continue to do what you're doing,'' Dr. Diamond said. That is, wear a
mask, keep six feet away from people and stay home as much as possible,
he said.

Dr. Diamond added, ``The behavior is really the thing that's going to
make the biggest difference.''
