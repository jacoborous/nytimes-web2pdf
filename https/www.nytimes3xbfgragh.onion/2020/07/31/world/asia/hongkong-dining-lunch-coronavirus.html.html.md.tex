City officials did a quick U-turn in the face of public anger, after
viral photos showed workers eating lunch on curbs and bridges in the hot
sun.

HONG KONG --- Hong Kongers have rarely seen their government react so
swiftly to public opinion.

On Thursday, city officials lifted a ban on dining in restaurants ---
imposed just a day earlier, to fight the spread of the coronavirus ---
after a public outcry sparked by
\href{https://twitter.com/yvonne_tg/status/1288356001519869952}{pictures}
of workers and older people eating outside in the punishing July heat,
on pavements, curbs and the steps of footbridges.

Hong Kong is battling its worst community outbreak since the pandemic
began, after initial success in containing the coronavirus. This month,
the death toll nearly doubled in a week --- as of Friday, it stood at 27
--- and infections sharply spiked.

Some new clusters were linked to nursing homes and restaurants, while
scores of other cases had no known origin. The government's initial
response included limits on restaurants' opening hours, with dining in
allowed until 6 p.m. but forbidden after that.

But with case numbers staying high, dine-in service was banned
altogether on Wednesday --- leaving many working-class residents, used
to grabbing a quick bite during the lunch hour at one of Hong Kong's
countless inexpensive restaurants, with nowhere to go.

Photos of the results quickly went viral, including one of
\href{https://twitter.com/hkcnews_com/status/1288336602721181696}{a
62-year-old cleaner} eating in a park during a downpour, huddled under
an umbrella. (``What can I do; I can only blame myself for being poor,''
a local news outlet, Citizen News, quoted the man as saying.)

Chan Chun-heung, 50, who sells vegetables at a wet market in the Wan
Chai District, said she had to eat her Wednesday lunch sitting on the
ground.

``I had to cover my food whenever someone walked past me, otherwise the
dust would get everywhere,'' Ms. Chan said. ``And it was so hot.''

Critics accused the government of failing to think about working people
who can't spend their lunch breaks in air-conditioned offices. Stung by
the reaction, officials scrambled to open 19 community centers across
the city as makeshift shelters where people could go for lunch.

Then, on Thursday, it reversed the policy altogether, announcing that
dining in for breakfast and lunch could resume the next day. (Dinner is
still limited to takeout or delivery.)

The mini-furor tapped into longstanding perceptions that Hong Kong's
policymakers, many of them well-heeled, are out of touch with how most
people live. (Carrie Lam, the city's unpopular leader, was once mocked
for
\href{https://hongkongfp.com/2017/01/23/leadership-hopeful-carrie-lam-attracts-ridicule-new-gaffe-toilet-paper/}{not
knowing where to buy toilet paper}.)

Daphne Ho, the organizing secretary of the Construction Site Workers
General Union, said many construction workers had crowded together in a
covered area for lunch on Wednesday. Others ate at dust-filled, poorly
ventilated construction sites, and some opted to skip lunch altogether,
she said.

``Many people thought, why couldn't Hong Kongers even have the dignity
to eat a meal?'' Ms. Ho said. ``Why did they have to squat in the
streets?''

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the

Ms. Chan, the vegetable seller, was relieved on Thursday to be able to
eat at one of the converted shelters near her market. A few other
residents ate takeout at sparsely distributed tables, all facing the
wall, while a pack of reporters waited outside to interview them.

Before the shelters were opened, a wide variety of venues --- including
churches, hotels, clinics, hair salons and art studios --- had offered
to let people eat in their facilities free. Critics of the government
were quick to tie that spirit of grass-roots solidarity to the city's
pro-democracy protest movement, which has seen a variety of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/11/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html}{mutual
aid networks} spring up.

Health officials have tied Hong Kong's current surge to incoming
travelers who had been exempted from quarantine requirements, including
airline crew, sailors and some business executives. (Quarantine rules
have since been tightened.)

Ben Cowling, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the
University of Hong Kong, said that unless crowds were present, eating
lunch outdoors was a ``low-risk activity, but not very comfortable.''

But the risks of dining in are also limited, he said, ``given the
measures that had already been put in place in restaurants, including
screens between tables, temperature checks and hand sanitizers.''
