We know American public schools do not guarantee each child an equal
education. Two decades of school reform initiatives have not changed
that. But when Chana Joffe-Walt, a reporter, looked at inequality in
education, she saw that most reforms focused on who schools were
failing: Black and brown kids. But what about who the schools are
serving? In this five-part series, she turns her attention to what is
arguably the most powerful force in our schools: White
parents.

## Episode One: The Book of Statuses

### Reported by Chana Joffe-Walt; produced by Julie Snyder; edited by Sarah Koenig, Neil Drumming and Ira Glass; editorial consulting by Eve L. Ewing and Rachel Lissy; and sound mix by Stowe Nelson

#### A group of parents takes one big step together.

  -   
    “Nice White Parents” is brought to you by Serial Productions, a New
    York Times Company.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    I started reporting this story at the very same moment as I was
    trying to figure out my own relationship to the subject of this
    story, white parents in New York City public schools. I was about to
    be one of them. When my kid was old enough, I started learning about
    my options. I had many. There was our zoned public school in
    Brooklyn, or I could apply to a handful of specialty programs — a
    gifted program, or a magnet school, or a language program. So I
    started to look around. This was five years ago now, but I vividly
    remember these tours. I’d show up in the lobby of the school at the
    time listed on the website, look around, and notice that all or
    almost all of the other parents who’d shown up for the 11:00 AM,
    middle-of-the-workday, early-in-the-shopping-season school tour were
    other white parents. As a group, we’d walk the halls, following a
    school administrator — almost always a man or woman of color —
    through a school full of black and brown kids. We’d peer into
    classroom windows, watch the kids sit in a circle on the rug, ask
    questions about the lunch menu, homework policy, discipline. Some of
    us would take notes. And the administrators would sell. The whole
    thing was essentially a pitch. We offer STEM. We have a partnership
    with Lincoln Center. We have a dance studio. They were pleading with
    us to please take part in this public school. I don’t think I’ve
    ever felt my own consumer power more viscerally than I did shopping
    for a public school as a white parent. We were entering schools that
    people like us had ignored for decades. They were not our places,
    but we were being invited to make them ours. The whole thing was
    made so much more awkward by the fact that nobody on those tours
    ever acknowledged the obvious racial difference, that roughly 100%
    of the parents in this group did not match, say, 90% of the kids in
    this building. I remember one time being guided into a classroom and
    being told that this was the class for gifted kids, and noticing,
    oh, here’s where all the white kids are. Everyone on our tour saw
    this, all of us parents, but nobody said anything, including me. We
    walked out into the hallway. A mom raised her hand and said, I do
    have one question I’ve been meaning to ask. And the group got quiet.
    I was thinking, OK, here it comes. But then she said, do the kids
    here play outside every day?

  - \[music\]

  - chana joffe-walt  
    I knew the schools were segregated. I shouldn’t have been surprised.
    By the time I was touring schools as a parent, I had spent a fair
    amount of time in schools as a reporter. I’d done stories on the
    stark inequality in public education. And I’d looked at some of the
    many programs and reforms we’ve tried to fix our schools. So many
    ideas. We’ve tried standardized tests and charter schools. We’ve
    tried smaller classes, longer school days, stricter discipline,
    looser discipline, tracking, differentiation. We’ve decided the
    problem is teachers, the problem is parents. What is true about
    almost all of these reforms is that when we look for what’s broken,
    for how our schools are failing, we focus on who they’re failing —
    poor kids, black kids, and brown kids. We ask, why aren’t they
    performing better? Why aren’t they achieving more? Those are not the
    right questions. There is a powerful force that is shaping our
    public schools, arguably the most powerful force. It’s there even
    when we pretend not to notice it, like on that school tour. If you
    want to understand why our schools aren’t better, that’s where you
    have to look. You have to look at white parents. From Serial
    Productions, I’m Channa Joffe-Walt. This is “Nice White Parents,” a
    series about the 60-year relationship between white parents and the
    public school down the block.
    
    \[CHILDREN CHATTERING\] I’m going to take you inside a public school
    building, an utterly ordinary, squat, three-story New York City
    public school building not far from where I live. This isn’t one of
    the schools I’ve toured. And my own kids don’t go here. They’re too
    little. This is a middle and high school called the School for
    International Studies, SIS. The story I want to tell you spans
    decades in this one school building, but I’m going to begin when I
    first encountered SIS, in the spring of 2015, right before
    everything changed. In 2015, the students at SIS were black, Latino,
    and Middle Eastern kids, mostly from working class and poor
    families. That year, like the year before and the year before that,
    the school was shrinking. The principal, Jillian Juman, was worried.

  - jillian juman  
    Yeah, so the last two years, we had 30 students in our sixth grade
    class. And so we really have room for 100. And so numbers, I think,
    are hard.

chana joffe-walt

Ms. Juman started to reach out to families from the neighborhood,
inviting them to please come take a look. Parents started showing up for
tours of SIS, mostly groups of white parents. Ms. Juman was thrilled and
relieved. She walked parents through the building, saying, stop me
anytime if anyone has any questions. Really, anything; I want you to
feel comfortable. And Ms. Juman says they did have questions, mostly
about the poor test scores. That was fair. Ms. Juman expected those
questions. She did not expect the other set of questions she got a lot
from parents.

  - jillian juman  
    Is there weapons? Is there — you know, are you scanning? Are you a
    scanning school, because kids are dangerous and they have weapons?
    I’ve heard that there’s —

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Scanning, like metal detectors?

  - jillian juman  
    Right. I heard there’s fights and those kinds of things. I don’t
    know what school you’re talking about. I have never heard of that
    incident ever happening, ever. So the fears of what this building is
    and what this building has represented has transcended itself.
    There’s a different story of International Studies outside this
    building.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    How much of that do you think is racism?

  - jillian juman  
    I think our entire society is fearful of the unknown.

chana joffe-walt

Excellent principal answer. Principal Juman is black, by the way. She
needed these parents. Schools get money per student. A shrinking school
means a shrinking budget. Ms. Juman was worried if this continued, the
middle school could be in danger of being shut down by the city. SIS is
in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. Leafy streets, brownstones, it’s a wealthy,
white neighborhood that’s gotten wealthier and whiter in the last
decade. But white families were not sending their kids to SIS. Ms. Juman
told these parents, choose SIS. We’re turning things around. We’re in
the process of bringing in a new, prestigious International
Baccalaureate curriculum, renovating the library. Here’s the new,
gorgeous yard. It’s an excellent school. The parents seemed interested,
but I believe that might have had just as much to do with what was
happening outside of the school as what they were seeing inside the
building.

  - rob hansen  
    Sure, so my name is Rob Hansen, and I’m a parent. So we were — the
    middle school process is interesting.

chana joffe-walt

Rob lives nearby SAS, but he had never heard of the school.

  - rob hansen  
    You know, probably eight school —

chana joffe-walt

In his district, Rob could choose from 11 middle schools. The majority
of white families sent their kids to the same three schools. Rob’s
white. Those were the schools he’d heard of, and those were the schools
he toured.

  - rob hansen  
    And it also had space.

chana joffe-walt

But they were packed. There were too many wealthy, white families in the
district to continue cramming into just three schools.

  - rob hansen  
    There’s a couple of citywide ones where we went and we stood on line
    for like an hour, an hour and a half, and then joined in an
    auditorium full of parents, and then had them announce that they
    were accepting 15 students in the following, in the coming class.

chana joffe-walt

And they’d been running tours all day. Most cities have some amount of
school choice like this, tours and options. New York City, though, is an
amped-up version of what happens elsewhere. The level of competition,
the level of wealth, the diversity of people sorting into different
schools, everything is more intense. Rob found this process frustrating,
although Rob is very even-tempered even when he’s frustrated. He’s
Canadian. When he gets especially hot, he starts calling things
“interesting.” And this whole middle school thing was very
interesting. He asked other parents on school tours, what are we going
to do? Someone said, have you guys heard of SIS, that building down the
block? Rob hadn’t. The others hadn’t. They decided to all go check it
out together.

  - rob hansen  
    I walked away, and lots of parents walked away from those tours
    thinking, wow, you know, people are jamming up into some schools,
    and you’re leaving 60 or 70 seats empty, empty all year long. If you
    have 30 kids, it doesn’t — that’s, you spread them out around, and
    that’s a big school, then all of a sudden, you’re sort of like, wait
    a second. What’s — there’s nobody here.

\[music\]

chana joffe-walt

As Rob toured SIS, he had an idea. That night, he emailed Principal
Juman, and he asked, would she be open to starting a dual-language
French program at SIS? They had one at the elementary school Rob’s kids
went to, and everyone loved it. Sure, Principal Juman was open. So Rob
started spreading the word. SIS is starting a dual-language French
program. We should all go. Rob says there was interest, but a lot of
people he talked to had this question. Wait, are other people going?

  - rob hansen  
    And families have that kind of fear. Like, what if I’m — if I look
    around, nobody else came with me. And I came for something that’s
    not here, because nobody — so it’s a collective action problem.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Wait, why is it a collective action? Why do you need a collective —

  - rob hansen  
    Well, just on the — just, I think, overall, there is a collective
    action issue. But if you’re interested in this, in part, because of
    the French dual-language part of it, if you’re the only one to show
    up, there’s no French teacher for one student. But there’s a program
    if 15 come, if 20 come. But we all have to, then, take one step
    forward at exactly the same time. The vision requires people to
    come. And what if nobody comes?

chana joffe-walt

When it came time to choose middle schools, parents are supposed to rank
their top choices. Right before they did, before everyone chose their
schools, Rob sent a survey out to the families he’d been talking to try
to ensure that a group of them would choose SIS together. It was a
simple SurveyMonkey. If enough people said Yes, they’d rank SIS as one
of their top picks, and they would be able to act as a collective.
People said Yes. The numbers were stunning. In 2014, there had been 30
sixth graders at SIS. In 2015, there would be 103. That 200% increase
was almost entirely white kids.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Did you think about yourself as integrators? Or did you think about
    —

  - rob hansen  
    No. \[LAUGHS\] My pause was because I was trying to think if that
    had gone through my mind. And no, no. The — not integrators.
    Participants in a school that was going to, hopefully, be diverse,
    but yeah, not — that’s not a framing or a way of thinking about it
    that would have occurred to me at the time. \[LAUGHS\]

chana joffe-walt

Nobody I talked to from SIS characterized what was happening there as
“integration.” But here’s why integration was on my mind. The New York
City Department of Education was aware their schools were segregated. It
was also aware that desegregation is the most effective way to close the
gap in achievement between black and white students. But it did not want
to mandate racial integration through zoning or school placements. The
city was trying to make integration happen through choice, hoping to
lure white families into segregated schools. The school tours I went on
for my own kids, the sparkly programs and amenities, that was the new
approach to integration. But can this work? For white parents to opt in
to integration not because we have to, or because it’s the right thing
to do, but because it’s a selling point? Because we get a dance studio,
and STEM, and a school that was, hopefully, diverse? Integration,
without talking about race. \[CHILDREN CHATTERING\] The kids at SIS,
though, they did talk about race — immediately. Fall 2015, the first few
weeks of school, a senior named Kristen leans over to her classmate,
Chris, and mumbles, there are a lot of white kids in the school. And
Chris says, oh, yeah, a teacher warned me about that over the summer.

  - chris  
    Like, he told me, like, oh, there’s going to be a lot of white kids
    coming in, French white kids from upper economic statuses. So be
    prepared for that.

chana joffe-walt

Kristen nods. Yeah, I guess we were prepared. And then she turns to me
to say, I should have been ready for that. We saw the parents on the
tours last year.

  - kristen  
    It was like we would see them walk to the hall, but we never knew it
    was so serious that a whole group of Caucasians would come in, like
    it would be so diverse. But mm-hmm, it’s such a big change. Like,
    not to be prejudiced or anything, but I noticed the big change. High
    schoolers are more Hispanics and Blacks, and with the few
    Caucasians, and then, the new group that came in were all
    Caucasians. They had tried to make it so diverse.

chana joffe-walt

“Diverse.” This was a word I heard over and over in the first few weeks
of school — “diversity.”

  - chris  
    I love diversity. So it doesn’t — so when I did see other white
    kids, I’m like, so?

chana joffe-walt

“Diversity” seemed to have two different definitions. White families
would talk about all the diversity at SIS, and they were talking about
Black and Hispanic kids. When kids of color noted the diversity, they
were referring to the new white kids. For a lot of kids of color, this
looked a lot like something they’d already seen happen in their
neighborhoods — white families showing up in large numbers, taking over
stores, familiar spots. There’s a word for that. It’s gentrification.
But I noticed that no one was using that word about the school. What was
happening here was “diversity.” That’s how the adults talked about it.
Diversity is a good thing, something you’re supposed to be OK with. For
the most part, the kids were. It was different for the parents. Some of
them saw specific advantages to the diversity, like Kenya Blount, the
co-vice president of the PTA at SIS. He was excited.

  - kenya blount  
    Having the new parents coming in and the diversity that, in
    particular, maybe comes from the new — as I’ll call it — the “new”
    neighborhood, the way that things are changing in the neighborhood,
    is that we have a gentleman who his profession is fundraising.

chana joffe-walt

Rob Hansen, the dad who started the SurveyMonkey. Rob raises money for
nonprofits and foundations for a living. Over the course of the year,
I’ll here Rob Hanson referred to as Todd Hanson, Ted Manson, Mr.
Handsome. Kenya was the only one who went with “the gentlemen whose
profession is fundraising.” The most common was just “the guy who gets
the money.” Rob told the PTA he was eager to raise money for the school.
To Kenya, this meant more resources at his own kids’ school. His boys
and all the kids could benefit.

  - kenya blount  
    He has brought on the challenge and taken it upon himself to raise
    $50,000. So —

  - chana joffe-walt  
    5-0?

  - kenya blount  
    5-0, with three zeros after that, yes — $50,000. Which, again, this
    again goes back to the whole, I’ll say, diversity thing and new
    people who were thinking outside the box. As our PTA, I don’t think
    that we were thinking that big.

chana joffe-walt

They were definitely not thinking that big. Because the PTA was run by
Imee Hernandez and her co-president, Susan Moesker. Imee is not a
gentleman who fundraises. She’s a social worker. The first time I met
Imee, she was wearing a T-shirt that said, “I’m not spoiled. My husband
just loves me.” She’s Puerto Rican, grew up in Brooklyn. Her husband
Maurice is Puerto Rican and Black and really does adore her. He grew up
in Brooklyn, too. They have one daughter, one pit bull, one Persian cat,
and one school.

  - imee hernandez  
    I make it my business to stick myself in her school. \[LAUGHS\]

chana joffe-walt

For Imee, the new diversity, it gave her pause.

  - imee hernandez  
    Like, what I saw in September the population that came in, I was
    like, oh, that’s a little frightening. \[LAUGHS\] And even the socio
    —

  - chana joffe-walt  
    If you could describe it for people who are on the radio and don’t
    know what you saw.

  - imee hernandez  
    I saw a lot of white people with very high socioeconomic
    backgrounds. You know, they have money. And that’s great, but money
    tends to scare people. And I’m one of the people it scares.
    \[LAUGHS\] I’m one of the people it scares, because it twists
    everything around, and I don’t like that. I don’t like that. I don’t
    like that — I’d rather have a dinner where people of different
    cultures bring their food and we share together than have somebody
    else cater it. Like, that’s how I feel you build community. I’m a
    social worker. That’s my background, and that’s what I believe in.

chana joffe-walt

Imee was in her second year at the school. The year before, she put on
community events, teacher appreciation, a spring carnival with face
painting and hot dogs. They raised some money here and there, but Imee’s
vision for the PTA wasn’t really about fundraising. The new parents,
though, they wanted to be active in their new school, and they were
accustomed to supporting their kids’ schools by fundraising. The two
approaches came face-to-face at a PTA meeting in October.

  - imee hernandez  
    Three more minutes.

  - speaker 1  
    All right, all right.

  - imee hernandez  
    And then it’s up to everyone —

  - speaker 1  
    Yes, I’m very —

  - imee hernandez  
    Because y’all got your — you got to go home.

  - speaker 1  
    I got my —

  - imee hernandez  
    \[LAUGHS\] You got to go home.

chana joffe-walt

There are about a dozen grownups, sitting on small plastic chairs around
a classroom table, the PTA Executive Board. Principal Juman is here,
too. Imee’s leading, and the principal jumps in. She says she wants a
minute to share how much the new fundraising committee had raised so
far. Imee looks confused. Principal Juman goes on to say, the new
fundraising committee has had a lot of success.

  - jillian juman  
    The total they have raised, according to Rob, about $18,000.

  - imee hernandez  
    Mm-hmm, OK.

  - jillian juman  
    And then, we just had a donation from a family a couple weeks ago
    who wanted to be anonymous that they’re going to give either 5 to 10
    grand in December. So this is big money.

chana joffe-walt

People seem unclear what to do with their faces. This is good news,
right? But also, wait, what’s the Fundraising Committee? Imee turns to
her husband, Maurice. A retired cop, Maurice is also the treasurer of
the PTA, because when he retired, his wife told him he couldn’t just sit
around at home. Maurice shrugs at Imee, doesn’t seem to know anything
about this new money. Imee turns back to Principal Juman. So can we use
that money?

  - imee hernandez  
    — answered my question.

  - jillian juman  
    Yeah.

  - imee hernandez  
    That was the question, if the PTA can have access to this money.
    Because I know already —

  - jillian juman  
    But what is the PTA? So that’s all part off the question that’s
    going around.

  - imee hernandez  
    Right, yeah.

  - jillian juman  
    So this $18,000 Rob has raised under the umbrella of PTA.

chana joffe-walt

That’s principal Juman.

  - imee hernandez  
    OK.

  - jillian juman  
    So — I think.

  - imee hernandez  
    But who’s — who’s got it? And where’s it going? Like, yeah.

  - speaker  
    This PTA member don’t know nothing about it, so you know? \[LAUGHS\]

  - maurice  
    How can that be access for Mr. Negrone.

chana joffe-walt

Maurice asks, how can that money be accessed for Mr. Negrone, who wants
new gym uniforms, or Mr. Lowe, to get his microscopes? Imee nods

  - imee hernandez  
    I mean, God bless Rob, and more power to him.

  - jillian juman  
    Yeah.

  - imee hernandez  
    But he’s not an official member.

  - jillian juman  
    Right.

  - imee hernandez  
    So I think that’s what makes it confusing, at least for me. You
    know, he is a PTA member because he’s a parent, but he’s not part of
    the executive board. So I think that’s what makes it —

  - jillian juman  
    That’s probably true.

  - imee hernandez  
    Yeah, it makes it tricky.

  - jillian juman  
    Right.

  - imee hernandez  
    I mean, and again, I’m not \[INAUDIBLE\].

  - speaker  
    And then, I mean, I’m not going to lie —

  - imee hernandez  
    I he could bring in the money, that’s great, but you know —

chana joffe-walt

Principal Juman nods, repeats that she wishes Rob had been able to make
it. She was hoping everyone could be here and get on the same page about
money. But Rob is chaperoning a sixth grade overnight trip. They’re late
getting back. One mom, a white woman, who came in with a new group of
sixth graders, says, look, I know Rob. He means well.

  - speaker 1  
    I think Rob, he’s a professional fundraiser.

  - speaker 2  
    Yeah, he’s great.

  - speaker 1  
    And therefore, he took it as his initiative —

  - speaker 3  
    They need money.

  - speaker 1  
    — to do the fundraising.

  - speaker 3  
    Yep.

  - speaker 1  
    And I think that’s great. But I don’t — he should communicate with
    the PTA. And my impression is, I don’t think he’s meaning to offend
    anybody.

  - all  
    No.

  - speaker 1  
    I think he’s sort of so laser-focused. That he’s not thinking about,
    like, well, maybe you might want to let somebody know what he’s
    doing.

  - jillian juman  
    And he’s been amazing. He really has. Yeah, yeah.

chana joffe-walt

That’s principal Juman. At this point, everyone seems to feel a little
weird about how long they’ve spent talking about a fellow parent who is
not present. And anyway, it’s money for the school. We’re all for that.
We just need better communication. Imee she says, yeah, it’s just
usually, money raised by parents goes through the PTA, so we can all
talk about where to spend it.

  - speaker 1  
    Yeah, OK.

  - speaker 2  
    Because then we have to decide who has the say, because if it’s a
    collective PTA —

  - speaker 1  
    Hey\!

  - speaker 3  
    There’s Rob.

  - speaker 1  
    There he is.

  - speaker 4  
    There he is\!

  - rob hansen  
    Sorry I’m late.

  - imee hernandez  
    I can’t believe you made, after everything —

chana joffe-walt

Rob walks into the room. He just got back from the sixth grade trip. He
sits down, and they all start to talk. We need to sort out some
questions about money. Then, a mom from the fundraising committee says
she’s worried about me recording and asks me to stop. So I do.

  - maurice  
    It’s been requested, but we don’t know —

chana joffe-walt

They let me stay, though, and take notes. Rob apologizes and then
explains. A group of them have been meeting to raise money for the
school. The new dual-language French program is expensive, and they
promised the principal they’d help raise money to cover it. They were
just eager to help, Rob says, so they formed a committee. He’s really
sorry. He should have communicated and coordinated better with the PTA.
But good news is, it’s going great. Someone has a contact with the
French embassy, a guy at the Cultural Services Arm in New York, and he
says he wants to help cover the costs of new French teachers and books.
They’ve already kicked in around 10 grand. At this point in my notes, I
wrote, “lots of looks, big money.” Rob says, “The embassy suggested we
do a fundraiser, an event. They can help.” Here I wrote, “Looks —
confused, mad? Nobody really talking.” Imee says, “This fundraiser will
be at the school though, right? And free, for everyone?” Rob says,
“Yes.” “Good, good.” She asks one more time, “Free? I just want to
make sure everyone can go.” Lots of nods. Rob says, “Totally. This is a
community event, for our community.” After about 20 minutes, Imee says,
we’re out of time, guys. I can’t tell if this is out of a professional
commitment Imee has to stick to the schedule, or a personal commitment
to getting out of that room.

\[music\]

chana joffe-walt

Before I came to SIS, I never thought much about the role of PTAs —
ever. At SIS, early on, I have this feeling of, oh, a PTA is actually
critical to the success of an integrated school. A PTA has a very simple
democratic structure. Every parent has an equal vote. Smart — it’s like
a built-in system to equalize power, to help them make a budget
together, make decisions, set priorities collectively — or not.

  - imee hernandez  
    So we’re lucky enough that we have Rob here, who has really taken
    over fundraising and tried to bring it to the next level here at our
    school. So —

chana joffe-walt

It’s another PTA meeting, and the whole collective thing is not really
happening. It seems like the new parents are still raising money
separate from the PTA, and the communication problems do not seem to be
resolved. And some of the new parents have an idea. They propose a
formal separation — the PTA and the people doing fundraising. Rob says
this way, there’ll be two organizations collecting money for SIS.

  - rob hansen  
    — is there will be two sorts of ways dollars are raised. One would
    be a community raise — bake sales, direct gifts.

chana joffe-walt

That would be the PTA side, the community fund. Then there would be a
separate organization that would go after grants and big donors. Up
until this point, there seemed to be tension bubbling under the surface
between the new parents and the old parents, but it wasn’t really until
this moment that the unsaid started to get said — mostly by Imee’s
husband, Maurice.

  - maurice  
    I think a lot of us feel that there’s two different groups. There’s
    the fundraising group and the PTA, which is — That’s what it looks
    like. You guys have this goal of making $50,000 that is going to the
    French program. Now, as you said, what about the rest of your
    school? Where’s all this money going? We have no answer. We don’t
    know.

  - maureen  
    And it’s very easy to feel steamrolled.

chana joffe-walt

That’s Maureen, a white mom who’s new. There are lots of nods.

  - maureen  
    And I just don’t want —

chana joffe-walt

Maurice is asking, is this new money you’re talking about, is it just
for the new French dual-language program? Which is another way of
asking, is this money just for your kids, or is it for everybody? Rob
says emphatically, it’s for everybody. Maurice says, really?

  - maurice  
    I mean, that’s being naive. We think, OK, they’re going to donate
    all this money through the French embassy, and we’re going to, OK,
    well, we’re going to buy new chalkboards. That’s kind of — that’s
    being naive. Now, you’re saying the 50,000 will be for the PTA
    community to decide where it’s going to go. So I mean, I hear what
    you’re saying, which sounds great. But again, maybe I’m still
    talking about last meeting, when Jillian said, OK, well, are we only
    get a percentage of that? So we still don’t have an answer.

chana joffe-walt

Later, talking to Rob, I learned that the new separate fundraising arm
he’s talking about is actually a foundation. They want to create a
school-based foundation at SIS. The plan is to call it the Brooklyn
World Project. I asked Rob, why do you need another way to raise money?

  - chana joffe-walt  
    There’s a PTA. Most people have heard of a school PTA. Why do you
    need a separate organization that’s not the PTA?

  - rob hansen  
    Yeah, so probably the easiest way to explain it is to not think
    about it from the school side, but to think about it from the
    potential donor side. So basic idea that we’re following is that the
    — let’s say the international says, we want to do extend today, and
    we want to do theater. And so we go and we find a donor who loves
    theater, and loves the French language, and loves the idea that kids
    who’ve never spoken French and had no exposure get the chance to go
    and compete, actually, against some of the most established schools
    in the city. And a donor just loves that. Like, I love it. I love
    giving that kind of opportunity to kids. I’m going to cover all of
    that, because I think it’s that important. If that money goes to the
    PTA, you could have a situation that the PTA says, or members that
    PTA say, I don’t know that we really like the theater program. I’m
    not sure I think that we should be using those dollars to do x, or
    y, or z. Now, normally, you’d be able to say, well, donor intent is
    what it is. You should probably use it towards what it was intended
    for.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    You mean normally, in another fundraising context?

  - jillian juman  
    Yeah, meaning in nonprofits. So there’s a basic kind of morality of
    a nonprofit to say, if a donor gives you it to you to do something,
    you should try to do that. Donor intent is an important part of it.
    It’s sort of a trust that’s established.

chana joffe-walt

Rob says, because the PTA is a democracy, it makes things complicated.
The very thing I saw as a strength of a PTA — one parent, one vote — to
Rob, that’s a problem for fundraising. Parents come and go and change
their minds about what’s important. A private donor wants stability, and
Rob is trying to raise money for the kind of programming that was
available at his son’s wealthy elementary school. At that school, Rob
was co-president of the PTA, and the previous year, his PTA pulled in
close to $800,000. $800,000 — money that paid for after school
programming, and ballroom dancing, chess, art, music, a garden. $800,000
for a school that is 75% white and serves a tiny fraction of the poor
kids in the district. There aren’t enough wealthy parents at SIS to
raise that kind of money. That year, Rob helped raise $800,000, the SIS
PTA raised $2,000. So Rob was trying to be creative. A foundation was a
way for his new school to catch up. The school leadership, the
principal, was behind the idea. . Ms. Juman told me she saw the
foundation as a path to equity and access. More resources meant they’d
be able to provide all kids with opportunities — like, say, a school
trip to France. But the parent leadership, they found it annoying. Imee
knew the new parents were trying to help the school. But she already
liked the school. She felt like she was being saved against her will.
Plus, they’re new, she said. Shouldn’t we be the ones helping them? She
was fine with them bringing in ideas, but she didn’t understand why they
hadn’t brought them to her first. They hadn’t thought to consult her.
She to me, multiple times, why are they coming up with all these private
plans and meeting in secret committees?

  - jillian juman  
    You were pissed about that.

  - imee hernandez  
    Totally.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Yeah.

  - imee hernandez  
    Because I wasn’t involved.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    I mean, why were you angry about that?

  - imee hernandez  
    Because here I am trying to build something with the school. Why
    didn’t you just involve me? Why didn’t you just tell me about it?
    Like, it felt like it was a secret. I don’t know if it was or if it
    wasn’t. I’m invested in the school. Clearly, I’ve proven to you I’m
    invested in the school. And you couldn’t tell us that you wanted to
    fundraise in a different way?

chana joffe-walt

Rob and the new parents did tell the principal that they wanted to
fundraise in a different way, but Imee felt like, what about the rest of
us? She felt like the PTA was ignored. At that last meeting, Imee went
quiet. She told me she just felt enraged, and then embarrassed for
feeling so enraged.

  - imee hernandez  
    I guess I just threw a tantrum. \[LAUGHS\] And I just didn’t want to
    be a part of it. Which is not right, but I think, again, in the
    moment, I just felt like — I was hurt.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Do you usually throw — was the tantrum the thing I saw? Because that
    did not seem like a tantrum.

  - imee hernandez  
    No, that was not a tantrum. I could have been a lot worse, and I was
    really, really trying to restrain myself. Yeah, I really was. That
    was really under control — really, really under control. It wasn’t,
    but it was really, really under control.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    I asked, was there another time?

  - imee hernandez  
    Tantrum? Yeah, at home with my husband. \[LAUGHS\] That’s when I
    threw my tantrum.

chana joffe-walt

So it was tense, among the parents. But this is a school for children.
Did it matter if the adults were not getting along, or who controlled
which pot of money? Yes. Yes it did. That’s coming up after the break.
The school year went on. Rob’s fundraising committee moved forward with
the French Embassy to plan a fundraiser. It was now being called a
“gala.” The PTA moved forward with parent volunteers to plan a spring
carnival. It was being called “the spring carnival.” Quiet resentments
locked in place. On the phone one night, Imee’s co-president on the PTA,
Susan Moesker, told me she worried the school was changing in ways that
were damaging to the community. Susan is white herself, but she didn’t
come in with the new white parents. When she started, her son was one of
the only white kids in the school. And now she felt like they were all
being written into a narrative that wasn’t true, that SIS was a bad
school before, and now that the new white families had arrived, it was
being turned around.

  - susan moesker  
    It is noticeable. I think it is something that even my child has
    picked up on — just like a very different feeling among some of the
    students and some of the parents, this real sense again that here
    they come to save our poor struggling school that couldn’t possibly
    make it on its own without their money and their vision. And we do
    not all feel that that is, necessarily, the case.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    What do you feel?

  - susan moesker  
    \[SIGHS\] \[LAUGHS\] Ah —

chana joffe-walt

This was a long conversation. The upshot? She’s not happy with the way
the new parents are behaving. It was true. A new narrative was taking
hold at SIS. It’s not like the kids were talking about it all the time,
but it was in the air, and the kids were starting to pick up on who was
valued and why. In the cafeteria, I’d hear middle schoolers saying, the
French kids could kill someone, and they’d get away with it. Upstairs in
the high school, I’d hear kids complain, all the attention has shifted
to the new middle schoolers. We’re being pushed aside. And down in the
library, I met three sixth grade boys, white boys new to SIS. They’re
sweaty from playing soccer and looking very small against their huge
backpacks. These boys, even at 11 years old, they’ve absorbed the same
messages — that SIS wasn’t so good before. It was a bad school.

  - boy  
    The kids wouldn’t pay attention, and they had all the — zone out
    every little thing. And I bet they learned very little. And now,
    this generation, with us, I think we’re doing a lot better, and I
    think that we’re learning at a much faster pace.

chana joffe-walt

He and his friends, they’ve turned the school around. That’s what he’s
learning.

  - boy  
    It’s going to be one of the top choices. Already, in the Brooklyn,
    when you’re applying to middle schools, you get a book on statuses
    and stuff. And I think this school is actually really high up in the
    statuses.

chana joffe-walt

Nobody calls it “the book on statuses.” They call it a directory of
schools, with info like enrollment numbers for different schools, test
scores, and special programs. But I love the calls it, “the book on
statuses,” because this is what happened at SIS. The school had a bad
reputation among white families, and then, suddenly, it was in demand.
Its status had changed because of the white kids. A powerful draw for
white families into any school is other white families. Once you have a
critical mass of white kids, you pass what one city calls “a bliss
point.” This is a real thing researchers study — how many white kids are
needed at a school to make other white families feel comfortable
choosing it. That number, the bliss point, is 26%. That fall, white
families were crowding the school tours at SIS, not because the test
scores had improved — the new scores hadn’t even come out yet — but
because the other white families made them feel blissfully comfortable.

\[music\]

chana joffe-walt

Of course, the thing that made the new white parents comfortable coming
to SIS in the first place was the promise of a French program. They
wanted French, and they got French. So now, all the sixth, seventh,
eighth, and ninth graders are learning French. It wasn’t a true
dual-language program where kids learned in French for half the day or
whatever. That first year, most of the French was happening in the after
school program. You’d sign up for regular after school stuff like
culinary, or soccer, or drama, and it would be conducted in French.

  - teacher  
    Hey, hey\! \[KIDS CHATTERING IN FRENCH\]
    
    Hey, everybody, you have to listen, OK?

chana joffe-walt

We’re in the auditorium. And it’s sweet. The kids are onstage rehearsing
this play they wrote in French. And it’s like they’re having fun. But I
couldn’t help feeling like there’s something off balance about this.
Most of the kids doing this drama program seem to be native French
speakers, but not all. A sixth grader named Maya is standing to the side
of the stage, script in hand, waiting for her line.

  - imee hernandez  
    For me, it’s a bit weird, because I have no idea they’re saying.
    Yeah.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Really? Even in the play that you’ve been practicing, you don’t know
    what they’re saying?

  - imee hernandez  
    Yeah, I don’t know what they’re saying still.

  - maurice  
    You have the translations of the script.

  - maya  
    Yeah, but sometimes, when a teacher talks in French to the class, I
    don’t understand.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    And do you figure it out? Or is it confusing?

  - maya  
    Confusing.

chana joffe-walt

Still, she’s excited. She’s grinning, watching the other kids on stage.
She’s hanging out with her friend Constance. Maya gets up to deliver her
lines.

  - maya  
    \[FRENCH\]?

  - constance  
    Oh you did a wrong line.

  - maya  
    Yeah, what?

  - constance  
    \[FRENCH\].

  - maya  
    That’s confusing.

  - constance  
    You just say \[FRENCH\], and then \[FRENCH\] is \[FRENCH\] after.

chana joffe-walt

Constance, a native French speaker, tells Maya, you said the wrong
thing. Constance correct her, pronounces it for her.

  - constance  
    \[FRENCH\].

  - maya  
    \[FRENCH\].

  - teacher  
    But it’s OK.

  - maya  
    Yeah, because I can’t do it that well.

chana joffe-walt

Maya says, I can’t, and her friend says, I’ll do it for you.

  - constance  
    OK, I’ll just say it.

  - maya  
    \[FRENCH\].

  - constance  
    \[FRENCH\].

chana joffe-walt

Learning another language is not new to Maya.

  - maya  
    My dad speaks Arabic, and my mom’s Turkish.

  - jillian juman  
    Uh-huh, and now you’re learning French.

  - maya  
    Yes, it’s so confusing. Three languages at the same time.

\[music\]

chana joffe-walt

When the new white parents asked for a dual-language French program at
SIS, Principal Juman said yes. SIS was supposedly an international
school, but she told me they didn’t really have a lot of international
programming, so it seemed like a good idea to her. But there was no
school-wide debate about it, or consensus. The community didn’t decide.
What if they had? More than 1/3 of the families at sis are Hispanic.
What if the dual-language program was Spanish, or Arabic? 10% of the
students speak Arabic. If they had made a different choice, if SIS had a
dual-language Arabic program, Maya would be teaching Constance how to
read her lines. She’d be the one explaining the cultural references and
teasing her friend about her terrible accent. She’d be the one
translating the teacher’s stage directions. There was money for a French
program, which meant that at SIS, French had value. Arabic didn’t.
Spanish didn’t. That’s something Maya is learning at school, along with
her French script.

From the very beginning, Imee and the others had insisted on three
things from the new parents and the fundraising committee — that the
gala fundraiser they were planning with the French Embassy, would,
number one, be open to everyone, number two, take place at the school,
and number three, be free. Then, four weeks before the gala, the PTA
asked for an update, and a parent named Deb showed up — a mom to a new
sixth grader, part of Rob’s fundraising committee.

  - deb  
    So I will start with the fact that I had a nice conversation with —

  - fabrice  
    Fabrice.

  - deb  
    Fabrice. Is it Fabrice?

  - fabrice  
    Fabrice, yeah.

chana joffe-walt

Deb volunteered early on to help organize the party and she tells
everyone, I met with our partner, Fabrice, at the French Embassy, and
the event can’t be at the school. The embassy won’t be able to draw
their supporters to Brooklyn. It’ll be at the Cultural Services Building
on the Upper East Side, Manhattan, 45 minutes away.

  - deb  
    I apologize if I’m saying things you guys already know, but I didn’t
    know some of this info, so it was good. But the event is really —
    it’s their event. It’s not really our event.

  - susan moesker  
    Oh\!

  - deb  
    It’s their event.

chana joffe-walt

That’s Susan with the “Oh.” Maurice leans forward, elbows on the table.
Imee is not here. She knew the meeting would be almost entirely about
fundraising, and she’s sitting this one out. Maurice is now
concentrating on Rob, who turns to Deb and says, “In what sense is that
their event?” “They make the rules, she says.”

  - deb  
    With our input, but there are certain things that are not flexible.
    The biggest thing is, nobody will be allowed in at the door. You
    have to be on a list. You have to RSVP. You have to be on the list.
    All names.

chana joffe-walt

Security. It’s a government building after all.

  - deb  
    He sends out the invitation to 22,000 people on his mailing list. So
    now, making it a free event is a problem, because now we’re inviting
    22,000 people for free to drink wine and eat food that may not have
    any interest in us. So we thought the best thing to do would be a
    suggested donation. Can’t afford to go?

  - rob hansen  
    Can I give a variant on that?

  - deb  
    Yeah.

chana joffe-walt

That’s Rob, asking to give a variant, which is, how about we have a
separate invitation for our people that doesn’t ask for any money? Rob
seems to be picking up on the instant irritation in this room, and he’s
adding many variants to Deb’s report.

  - rob hansen  
    It’s either a modified version, or just a clarity that everybody in
    this community —

  - deb  
    He won’t. There’ll be one invite. It will say the same thing. That’s
    what I suggested. I suggested $50 a head on the outside.

  - rob hansen  
    Even if we simply put a cover note saying, no charge. We want you to
    come join us, our community.

  - deb  
    Right, but on the invite, it will say, “suggested donation.” Then,
    if you want to — however we want to forward it, we can say that. But
    they will only do one invite.

chana joffe-walt

Deb hasn’t been able to make previous PTA meetings. So all Deb knows is
she got an email from the fundraising committee at her kid’s new school,
which she assumed was part of the PTA. She’s volunteering her time, a
ton of her time, to organize a huge event. She does not understand that
the email list she’s on is for a separate fundraising committee that
just became even more unpopular with the official PTA leadership. I
think I stopped moving watching Deb. It’s so tense. She’s like a
porcupine who’s just wandered into a balloon store.

  - deb  
    They’re serving wine, water, and then French hors d’oeuvres. And as
    far as the auction, we have a couple of cleanses. We have
    restaurants. We have a soccer camp. We have a vacation rental in
    California. We’ve got a couple hair salons. Very few from the
    community here, and that’s really when I wanted to talk about.

  - speaker  
    Is he from the parent community or geographic community?

  - deb  
    Parent community and geographic community.

chana joffe-walt

Deb says at her kid’s elementary school, they got a lot more donated
items from parents. She tells the room, you can ask at the restaurants
you go to if they do gift certificates. The salon, your employers —
you’d be surprised what people can offer. Just ask.

  - deb  
    Then that’s what people like my friends — and most of my friends,
    though, they’re all in other schools. I’m just new here. I don’t
    really know many people. So the only people I’ve been able to reach
    out to are the 36 on Rob’s email list. \[LAUGHTER\] And then, a
    quarter of them gave, have donated something already, like found
    something. So I’m telling you, that house in Sonoma County is
    gorgeous — four bedrooms, three baths, beautiful.

chana joffe-walt

I think about a PTA meeting a few months before where I watched Imee
gently explain to one of the new parents why it might be hard for some
families to throw in $5 for classroom supplies, that even being asked to
donate can feel alienating. Some people in this room seem to be
experiencing this whole thing as a routine update about public school
volunteering. Others look like someone who’s walked into the wrong room
and is now looking around to the friends they came with for affirmation,
we’re in the wrong room, right? How do we get out?

  - deb  
    Usually, I get more tickets to shows, games, things like — I’ve
    gotten Broadway tickets, but I haven’t gotten anything in the ticket
    arena. Knicks?

  - speaker  
    I have a contact at the Knicks. I’m willing to reach out.

  - deb  
    Yeah, they always go. Everybody wants to go to a game. There’s
    always somebody. And they also make great Christmas gifts. And
    that’s the other thing we’re lacking, is actual items. We used to
    have a parent — well, we still have the parent, but she’s not in my
    school — that worked at Tiffany. And we always had some beautiful
    Tiffany pieces, or a Coach bag, some products — makes it look nice.

\[music\]

chana joffe-walt

I spent a small chunk of that meeting occupied by an admittedly
sentimental thought. Just looking around, the room was kind of
incredible. People with homes in Sonoma and people who live in public
housing, sitting together at a long wooden table in the library of a
public school that they all share. That never happens. And I didn’t want
them to mess it up. But of course, they are. This is not something we
have a lot of practice in. New York City has one of the most segregated
school systems in the country. White parents here have very little
practice sharing public schools. Maybe this is all to be expected. White
parents will charge ahead, will sometimes be careless, secretive, or
entitled. In response, parents of color will sometimes be cautious, or
distrustful, defensive. These are well-established patterns, repeated
over generations. It’s easier for us to continue operating on separate
tracks, because it’s what we already know how to do.

The guy from the French embassy apparently has a mailing list of 22,000
people in the New York area. 300 people RSVPed to the gala for SIS. I
couldn’t believe it. And I couldn’t believe that one of them was Imee.

  - susan moesker  
    Hello. Good evening\!

  - chana joffe-walt  
    You guys look lovely.

  - imee hernandez  
    Hi, how are you? \[LAUGHS\]

chana joffe-walt

Imee, Maurice, and Susan carpooled together to the Upper East Side. It’s
winter. Central Park is across the street. It’s cold. Imee told me she
decided she needed to be a grown-up and come. They got stuck in traffic,
so they’re rushing up the sidewalk.

  - imee hernandez  
    We’re not that late, are we, Susan?

  - susan moesker  
    It’s not serious.

  - imee hernandez  
    No, we’re not that late.

chana joffe-walt

The Cultural Services Building is ivy-covered with columns. The doors
are wrought iron. The entryway is marble.

\[music\]

  - susan moesker  
    All right, you guys all came in together? All right.

chana joffe-walt

A huge marble staircase winds up the side of the room. Later, I look up
the architectural style — Italian renaissance, Palazzo style. It’s a
palace. There are people milling, sampling 17 different cheeses. I don’t
recognize anyone else from the school. Who are these people who have
chosen to come out on a weekday evening for a fundraising event for a
not-prominent or well-known-at-all public school in Brooklyn?

  - man  
    I’m not involved with the school, but my wife is involved with the —

chana joffe-walt

I started asking people how they heard about the event.

  - jillian juman  
    And what brought you here tonight?

  - barbara  
    Actually, an invitation by my wonderful French professor.

chana joffe-walt

A lady named Barbara tells me she’s never heard of SIS, like most people
here, but she loves French, and she loves Paris, and it sounded like a
fun night with other people who do too. She goes to France every year.

  - barbara  
    October is my saison preferee. Actually, I found this October too
    warm, but I like it when it’s a nice fall, crisp, and you wear your
    scarf, your foulard.

chana joffe-walt

I enjoy a person who likes to talk, where you can just get on the ride
and sit back. Barbara is definitely that kind of person.

  - barbara  
    And my apartment in Paris, it’s sort of — I’m confused sometimes. I
    say, am I in Gramercy Park, or am I in Saint-Germain-des-Pres? It’s
    got a similar ambiance of being a neighborhood. It’s great. Have you
    been?

  - chana joffe-walt  
    I’ve never been.

barbara

Oh my god, she hasn’t been to Paris. Barbara’s looking around for her
French teacher to tell her the news. Barbara’s teacher, it turns out,
heard about this evening the same way most people here did. She was
invited by this man, Fabrice.

  - fabrice  
    For the School for International Studies, we are hoping we will
    raise $100,000 each year for the next seven years.

chana joffe-walt

Fabrice Germain works for the Cultural Services arm of the French
Embassy. He tells me he’s fundraising for dual-language programs in
public schools because his mission is to promote French language and
culture. He called it “soft power,” which I was kind of surprised he
said out loud, since I associate that with something we do in developing
countries, not something you’re allowed to do in American public
schools. After Fabrice and I talked, I walked into the main room and
immediately saw Maurice. Maurice was so skeptical of this whole embassy
thing, but there he is at a table, selling raffle tickets next to Imee,
cheerfully raising money for a program neither of them ever wanted at
their school.

  - maurice  
    We are raffling off two airline tickets to France. Warm blue
    ticket’s going to win. It could be yours\!

chana joffe-walt

Maurice, amiable as ever, is trying — and mostly failing — to convert
ticket sales into social connections. He asks everyone, so if you win,
when are you thinking of going? Oh, you’re going anyway? For Easter? Oh,
nice.

  - maurice  
    How’s your there in Easter?

  - speaker  
    Yes, I am from France.

  - maurice  
    How’s the weather there in Easter?

  - speaker  
    Good. Fantastic. I’m — before we do it, I have a question. Can I
    from here, from this ticket, buy something to go from Paris to
    Marseille, when I’m leaving?

  - maurice  
    No.

chana joffe-walt

Barbara, from Gramercy Park, the woman who loves fall in Paris, wanders
across the marble floor toward the raffle table, beside where Imee is
sitting. And I thought, oh, no.

  - imee hernandez  
    It’s a pleasure to meet you.

  - barbara  
    Hi, how are you?

  - imee hernandez  
    Good, thank you.

  - barbara  
    You’re one of the parents of a bilingual student?

  - imee hernandez  
    She’s not bilingual, but she does go to the school. \[LAUGHS\]

  - barbara  
    She will be bilingual, eventually.

  - imee hernandez  
    Oh, she will be, yes, eventually.

  - barbara  
    What a wonderful thing. Are you pleased with the program?

  - imee hernandez  
    Yes, I love the school.

  - barbara  
    It’s so important to learn another language. It opens the world for
    you. And what is your name?

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Chana.

  - barbara  
    Anna. I was just telling Anna, when I go to Paris, which I do every
    year —

  - imee hernandez  
    Cool\!

  - barbara  
    It is cool. And it’s cooler because I can speak the language. And
    you have entree into their society. Not totally; one will never have
    total entree. But you can interact with your neighbors. You can
    interact in a restaurant. You can interact at the dry cleaner, at
    the supermarket. And they so appreciate an American who can speak
    French.

  - imee hernandez  
    Yes, yes.

  - barbara  
    And the language is beautiful.

chana joffe-walt

Imee starts looking around. Maurice moves closer and leans in to hear
why his wife is doing that nervous laugh, as Barbara explains Imee, a
Puerto Rican woman, that being bilingual makes a person more
sophisticated. Imee is exceedingly polite.

  - barbara  
    Paris is a lodestar, and if you really want to enjoy it, you’ve got
    to speak the language.

  - imee hernandez  
    \[LAUGHS\] It was a pleasure. Thank you.

chana joffe-walt

That entire conversation, Imee never mentioned to Barbara that she does
speak another language — Spanish. Later, I ask her why. She shrugs it
off.

  - imee hernandez  
    \[LAUGHS\] I was like, no, I’ll just let her talk. It’s OK. It was
    all right. So —

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Do you remember when you were telling me about the silent tantrum
    that you’re having —

  - imee hernandez  
    Yes.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    How would I know if that was happening?

  - imee hernandez  
    You wouldn’t. Only my husband would. \[LAUGHS\] If I’m throwing a
    silent tantrum. He would know if I’m throwing a silent tantrum. Is
    that happening right now?

  - maurice  
    No, not right now.

chana joffe-walt

Imee turns her back to her husband, facing me, and behind her, Maurice
is looking right at me, nodding vigorously — yes.

So here we were in our fancy clothes on the Upper East Side of
Manhattan, raising money for a French program at an utterly normal
Brooklyn public school. That was already weird. But the toasts — the
toasts were when the cognitive dissonance of the evening really kicked
in for me. Fabrice steps up onto the marble staircase and clinks his
glass, announces it’s time to celebrate what we’ve created and raise
some money.

  - fabrice  
    It takes a village. It takes a dedicated principal. She’s here with
    us. It takes — \[CHEERS\] Yes, yes, yes.

chana joffe-walt

Fabrice hands the make to Principal Juman.

  - jillian juman  
    Hi\!

  - all  
    Hi

  - jillian juman  
    It’s so nice to see all of you. And I think the number one thing is
    I think all of us standing here believe in public education and
    believe that all students — \[APPLAUSE\] Yes.

chana joffe-walt

One by one, people are talking about equality, and diversity, and
community, and the meaning of public education. Here, at the Cultural
Services Palatial Palace, full of white people.

  - rob hansen  
    So I went on the sixth great trip, 11-year-olds going on an
    overnight trip up into the Catskills. I would not recommend doing
    that.

chana joffe-walt

Rob gives a toast about that time he went on the overnight trip. It
starts off OK, but then veers into strange and sort of cringe-y
territory. He’s on a ropes course, 40 feet up, looking down.

  - rob hansen  
    Below me was that diverse group of kids. They were diverse kids
    belaying me, making sure that when I jumped, they would actually
    cushion my fall. That day, each of those kids was going to climb up
    that pole and was going to have the same opportunity and the same
    challenge. And it made me think that that’s what this school is
    about. It’s about the opportunity to do the International
    Baccalaureate, the challenge of it, so the opportunity to explore
    French, and the challenge of it, for all kids. And —

chana joffe-walt

I agree with Rob. It’s great to give kids equal access to opportunity.
But what they’re being given access to are the opportunities that Rob
and the other white parents care about.

Downstairs, I find Susan, Imee’s PTA co-president, on a bench by
herself. She’s near the band, drinking wine, looking a little
dumbstruck. I ask if she’s OK. This is something else, she says. And
then she adds, it’s just hard to explain how this is a public school
fundraiser.

When the founder of American public education, Horace Mann, laid out his
vision for public schools back in the day, he rode his horse around
Massachusetts, podium to podium. And his pitch was common schools would
make democracy possible. They would bind us to one another, indoctrinate
us, give us the skills and tools we need for democratic living. Public
schools, he believed, would be the great equalizer. Rich and poor would
come together and develop what he called “fellow-feeling,” and, in doing
so, quote, “obliterate factitious distinctions in society.” For that to
happen, you need everyone in the same school together. At SIS, they’ve
gotten that far. Everyone was in the same school together. But there was
no equalizing. We can be in the same school together and not be equal,
just like we can be in the same country together. It’s not enough. What
do we do about that? After the gala, money poured into SIS, and more
white families enrolled their kids at the school. But in the years after
that, there was a backlash, and SIS changed in ways that made Rob
question himself. He wondered if he’d made mistakes. He told me he
thought they all wanted the same thing for the kids. He just didn’t
know. Not knowing? That happens a lot with white parents. I looked into
the history of this school, and I learned that this wasn’t the first
time white parents showed up here. White parents have been involved all
along, all the way back to the very beginning of this school half a
century ago, doing the same kinds of things I’d just seen. It happens
again and again, white parents wielding their power without even
noticing, like a guy wandering through a crowded store with a huge
backpack, knocking things over every time he turns.

Horace Mann believed public schools would make us equal, but it doesn’t
work. I’m not sure how to fix that, but I want to lay out the story, the
whole story of this one American public school, because what I am sure
of is that in order to address inequality in our public schools, we are
going to need a shared sense of reality. At the very least, it’s a place
to start. That’s next time on “Nice White Parents.”

## Episode Two: ‘I Still Believe in It’

### Reported by Chana Joffe-Walt; produced by Julie Snyder; edited by Sarah Koenig, Neil Drumming and Ira Glass; editorial consulting by Eve L. Ewing and Rachel Lissy; and sound mix by Stowe Nelson

#### White parents in the 1960s fought to be part of a new, racially integrated school in Brooklyn. So why did their children never attend?

</div>

  -   
    “Nice White Parents” is brought to you by Serial Productions, a New
    York Times Company.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    The New York City Board of Education has an archive of all of its
    records. Everything that goes into making thousands of schools run
    for years and years is sitting in boxes in the municipal building. I
    love the B.O.E. archive.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Good morning. How are you doing?

chana joffe-walt

First of all, to look through it, you have to go to a century-old
municipal building downtown. Arched doorways, lots of marble, an echo,
vaulted ceilings really makes a person feel like she’s up to something
important. You sit at a table, and then a librarian rolls your boxes up
to you on a cart. Inside the boxes are all the dramas of a school
system. Big ones, tiny ones, bureaucratic, personal, it’s all in there.
There’s a union contract and then a zoning plan and special reports on
teacher credentialing, a weird personal note from a bureaucrat to his
assistant, a three-page single-spaced plea from Cindy’s grandmother, who
would please like for her not to be held back in the second grade. An
historian friend once pulled a folder out of the archive and a note fell
out, something a teacher clearly made a kid write in the 1950s, that
read, quote, “I am a lazy boy. Miss Fitzgerald says, when I go in the
army, I will be expendable. Expendable means that the country doesn’t
care whether I get killed or not. I do not like to be expendable. I’m
going to do my work and improve.”

I came to the Board of Ed archive after I attended the gala thrown by
the French embassy, the fundraiser for SIS organized by the new
upper-class white families coming into the school. I felt like I’d just
watched an unveiling ceremony for a brand-new school, but I didn’t
really know what it was replacing. Everyone was talking as if this was
the first time white parents were taking an interest in the School for
International Studies. But at the archive, I found out it wasn’t the
first time. White parents had invested in the school before, way before,
at the very beginning of the school. Before the beginning. I found a
folder labeled I.S. 293, Intermediate School 293, the original name for
SIS. And this folder was filled with personal letters to the president
of the New York City Board of Education, a man named Max Rubin, pleading
with him to please make I.S. 293 an integrated school. “Dear Mr. Rubin,
my husband and I were educated in public schools, and we very much want
for our children to have this experience. However, we also want them to
attend a school which will give them a good education, and today, that
is synonymous with an integrated school.” “Dear Mr. Rubin, as a resident
of Cobble Hill, a teacher and a parent, I want my child to attend
schools which are desegregated. I do not want her to be in a situation
in which she will be a member of a small, white, middle-income clique.”
These are letters from parents — largely white parents, as far as I
could tell — written in 1963, just a few years before I.S. 293 was
built. At issue was where the school was going to be built. The Board of
Education was proposing to build the school right next to some housing
projects. The school would be almost entirely Black and Puerto Rican.
These parents, white parents, came in and said, no, no, no, don’t build
it there. Put it closer to the white neighborhood. That way, all our
kids can go to school together. These parents wanted the school built in
what was known as a fringe zone. This was a popular idea at the time,
fringe schools to promote school integration. Comes up in the letters.
“Dear Mr. Rubin, this neighborhood is changing with the influx of a
middle-class group which is very interested in public education for
their children.” “Dear Mr. Rubin, if there is a possibility of achieving
some degree of integration, it is more likely if the Board of
Education’s theory of fringe schools is applied.” And from another
letter, “it is apparent from the opinion of the neighborhood groups
involved that the situation is not at all hopeless.” This lobbying
effort was so successful that the Board of Education did move the site
of the school. This is why SIS is located where it is today, on the
fringe, closer to the white side of town, so that it would be
integrated.

I tried to imagine who these people were — young, idealistic white
parents living in Brooklyn in the 1960s, feeling good about the future.
They would have had their children around the time the Supreme Court
ruled on Brown versus Board of Education. They probably followed the
news of the Civil Rights Movement unfolding down South. Maybe they were
supporters or active in the movement themselves. These were white
parents saying, we understand we’re at a turning point and we have a
choice to make right now, and we choose integration. One of my favorite
letters was from a couple who left the suburbs to come to New York City
for integration, the opposite of white flight. “Dear Mr. Rubin, we have
recently moved into the home we purchased at the above address in Cobble
Hill. It was our hope in moving into the neighborhood that our children
would enjoy the advantages of mixing freely with children of other
classes and races, which we were not able to provide to them when we
lived in a Westchester suburb.”

    So this is the letter.

  - carol netzer  
    This is the letter that I wrote? I can’t believe it. OK.

This is Carol Netzer. Most of the letter writers were not that hard to
find.

  - carol netzer  
    We had moved to Scarsdale for the children, because Scarsdale has
    the best — it probably still does — the best school system in the
    country, but we hated it. We found that we were bored to death with
    it. It was bland. It was just homogeneous. But living — I don’t know
    if you’ve ever lived in a suburb. It’s just boring, tedious, you
    know? There’s nothing going on.

chana joffe-walt

She didn’t like the suburbs. So they moved to Brooklyn and wrote that
letter, which I showed her, her 37-year-old self writing about her hopes
for her young children, the choices she made back then.

  - carol netzer  
    But it sounds as though I was fairly impassioned about it. You know,
    that it meant something. But I — actually, I can’t think what it
    meant.

\[music\]

chana joffe-walt

I went through this box of letters and called as many parents as I
could. Most of them didn’t remember writing these letters, which isn’t
surprising, more than 50 years ago and all. What I did find surprising
is that, by the time 293 opened, five years later, none of them, not a
one, actually sent their kids to I.S. 293.

\[music\]

From Serial Productions, I’m Chana Joffe-Walt. This is “Nice White
Parents,” a series about the 60-year relationship between white parents
and the public school down the block, a relationship that began with a
commitment to integration. In the 1960s, much like today, white people
were surrounded by a movement for the civil rights of Black Americans.
White people were forced to contend with systemic racism. And here was a
group of white parents who supported the movement for school
integration, threw their weight behind it. What happened in those five
years between 1963, when these white parents planted an impassioned
pro-integration flag on the school, and 1968, when it came time to
enroll their children? Why didn’t they show up?

These white parents who wanted an integrated I.S. 293, they didn’t come
to that idea on their own. They were part of a bigger story unfolding
around them. I want to zoom out to that dramatic story because it takes
us right up to the moment these parents wrote their letters, and then
made the decision not to send their kids to the school. To begin, I’d
like to introduce you to our main character in this historical, tale,
the recipient of the parents’ letters, the New York City Board of
Education. Back in the 1950s, the New York City Board of Ed was not one
of those boring bureaucracies that chugs along in the background,
keeping its head down. It had personality. It invested in self-image.
For instance, in 1954, when the Supreme Court found school segregation
unconstitutional, New York City didn’t just say we support that ruling,
it celebrated the Brown v Board decision. And notably, it celebrated
itself, calling Brown, quote, “a moral reaffirmation of our fundamental
educational principles.” That same year, 1954, the New York City Board
of Ed made a film honoring multiculturalism in its schools. \[CHILDREN
SINGING\] The film opens with a multiracial choir of schoolchildren
singing “Let Us Break Bread Together.” Like I said, the Board of Ed went
the extra mile. The Schools Superintendent was a 66-year-old man named
Dr. William Jansen, a man that newspapers described as slow and steady.
And he definitely delivers on that promise here.

New York City was the biggest city in America, with the largest Black
population in America, and it was saying in films, press releases,
public speeches, Brown v Board, we agree. Separate but equal has no
place in the field of public education. No problem here. It was also
saying, you know who does have a problem? The South. New York City loved
comparing itself to the backward South. There are plenty of examples of
this in the Board archives, New Yorkers bragging about their superiority
to places like Georgia or Virginia or Louisiana. This was the story the
Board of Ed was telling. The South was ignorant and racist. New York
City was enlightened and integrated. But here is what it was actually
like to walk into a New York City school in a Black neighborhood at this
time.

  - archived recording (mae mallory)  
    The school had an awful smell. It was just — oh, it smelled like
    this county abattoir.

chana joffe-walt

This is an archival recording of a woman named Mae Mallory. In the
1950s, Mallory’s two Black children were students in Harlem. And when
Mallory walked into their school, she did not see children building
brotherhood in interracial classrooms. She saw an all-Black and Puerto
Rican school with terrible facilities, in disrepair.

  - archived recording (mae mallory)  
    So my kids told me, says, well, Mommy, this is what we’ve been
    trying to tell you all along, that this place is so dirty. And this
    is why we run home to the bathroom every night. So I went to the
    bathroom. And in 1957 in New York City, they had toilets that were
    worse than the toilets in the schools that I went to in Macon,
    Georgia in the heart of the South. The toilet was a thing that
    looked like horse stalls. And then it had one long board with holes
    cut in it. And then you’d have to go and use the toilet, but you
    couldn’t flush it. The water would come down periodically and flush,
    you know, whatever’s there. Now imagine what this is like, you know,
    dumping waste on top of waste that’s sitting there waiting, you
    know, accumulating till the water comes. This was why this place
    smelled so bad.

chana joffe-walt

Mae Mallory says the school had two bathrooms for 1,600 children.
Mallory’s family fled racial violence in the South, like millions of
other Black Americans, who headed to places like New York City, where
everyone was supposed to be equal. Instead of welcoming these new
students and spreading them out, creating interracial classrooms, the
Board of Education kept Black and Puerto Rican students segregated in
what were sometimes referred to as ghetto schools, schools that were
often just blocks away from white schools. White schools in New York
City had toilets that flushed. White children had classrooms with
experienced teachers and principals, people who lived in their
communities and looked like them. In Black and Puerto Rican schools,
half the teachers were not certified to teach by the Board of Education.
The buildings were in disrepair, and packed, sometimes more than 1,000
kids in a single hallway. The overcrowding got so bad the Board of
Education decided to send kids to school in shifts. And mind you, this
was not in the middle of a global pandemic. This was normal, non-crisis
school for Black and Puerto Rican kids. One group of children would go
to school in the morning until noon. The next group of kids would come
in at noon, and stay until 3:00. The Board was literally giving Black
kids half an education. In some schools in Harlem, they had triple
shifts. This made it harder to learn elementary skills. Reading, for
instance. Black parents complained that the schools were not teaching
their kids basic literacy, that their white teachers didn’t care, that
the summer reading programs were only in white communities, that their
children were two years behind white children in reading. This at
exactly the same time the Board of Education was making a film promoting
the virtues of integration. It was effectively running a dual,
segregated and unequal school system.

\[music\]

For many Black families, the Board of Education was not to be trusted.
It did not care for Black children, and it didn’t respect the voices and
concerns of Black parents. Mae Mallory says she visited her kids’ school
that day because they’d come home the day before and told her a child
had died at school. He was playing in the street at recess. Mallory
hardly believed it, but she says when she visited the school, she
learned, yes, indeed, this child was playing the street because the
schoolyard was closed. He was hit by a beer truck. And she learned the
schoolyard was closed because pieces of steel from the side of the
building had fallen into the yard.

  - archived recording (mae mallory)  
    And when I found out that this was true, I went to the principal. So
    this principal told me that, well, Mrs. Mallory, you really don’t
    have anything to worry about. You see, our sunshine club went to see
    the mother, and we took her a bag of canned goods. So actually,
    she’s better off, because she had so many children to feed. And I
    couldn’t believe that here a white man is going to tell a Black
    woman in Harlem that a can of peaches is better than your child. I
    just didn’t know what to do or where to go. But I know you’re
    supposed to do something.

chana joffe-walt

It was 1957, three years after the Supreme Court declared segregation by
law unconstitutional. New York City didn’t have Jim Crow laws on the
books, but Mae Mallory would ask, the schools are segregated. What’s the
difference? She didn’t care whether that segregation was codified by law
or by convention. The harm was just as dire. And she wanted it
addressed.

  - archived recording (mae mallory)  
    This was nothing to do with wanting to sit next to white folks. But
    it was obvious that a whole pattern of Black retardation was the
    program of the Board of Education. So I filed a suit against the
    Board of Education. And I just fought back.

chana joffe-walt

Integration, Mae Mallory would say, was about, quote, demanding a fair
share of the pie. She said, our children want to learn, and they
certainly have the ability to learn. What they need is the opportunity.
The Board of Education had defined integration as a multiracial choir.
It was a virtue in and of itself. Mae Mallory saw integration as a
remedy, a way to get the same stuff everyone else had — functioning
toilets, books, certified teachers, a full school day. Integration was a
means to an end.

\[music\]

Mae Mallory won her lawsuit. She and a few other parents were allowed to
transfer their kids out of segregated schools. As for the segregation in
the entire system, the judge in the lawsuit turned to the Board of Ed
and said, this segregation, it’s your responsibility. Fix it.

Now, on the question of responsibility, the Board of Education was
cagey. And that caginess set the stage for the I.S. 293 parents when it
came time to send their kids to the school. Here’s what happened. The
Schools Superintendent, William Jansen, decided school segregation was
not his problem. In fact, he rejected the idea that New York City had
segregated schools in the first place. After all, New York City was not
barring Black children from entering white schools. This wasn’t the
South. Segregation, Jansen said, is such an unfortunate word. He
preferred the phrase racial imbalance or racial separation. The way he
saw it, racial imbalance in the schools was just a matter of housing.
Neighborhoods were segregated. Again, unfortunate, but that had nothing
to do with the schools. To make this argument, William Jansen had to
ignore the many powerful tools available to the Board of Education. The
Board of Education was responsible for where kids went to school. It
decided where to build new schools. It drew zoning lines. It decided
where experienced teachers teach. There were many ways the Board could
have made schools less segregated. I know this because of the Board’s
own reports. Jansen did very little to break up school segregation, but
man, did he study it. He organized commissions that led to reports that
led to further study. You see a pattern emerge, starting in the late
1950s, that looks something like this. Black parents and civil rights
groups would pressure the Board to act on segregation. The Board would
invite its critics to join a commission to investigate the problem. The
commission would study the schools, discover extreme segregation, lay
out solutions. The Board of Ed would then take a tiny step toward
implementing some of the recommendations until white parents started to
complain about the changes, at which point the Board would back off and
say it needed more evidence. Another commission, another report. For
instance, there’s the Report on the Committee on Integration, a Plan for
Integration, the City’s Children and the Challenge of Racial
Discrimination, Redoubling Efforts on Integration, the Board Commission
on Integration, the Status of the Public School Education of Negro and
Puerto Rican Children in New York City, and, my favorite, a bound little
red book from 1960 called Toward Greater Opportunity, which summarizes
the previous investigations with this groundbreaking conclusion. Quote,
“we must integrate as much and as quickly as we can.” I want to pause
for one second and step out of the past back into the world we all live
in, just to point out that, over the last few years in New York City,
we’ve been reliving this chapter of history. It’s eerie. New York City
schools are segregated. There’s a growing movement to do something about
that. And for the first five years of his administration, the city’s
mayor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, responded in the following way. He refused
to say the word segregation, commissioned a number of reports on school
diversity. He’s pointed a finger at housing problems as a way to say
this isn’t our fault, and he’s studying the problem deeply, which,
again, is not segregation, no matter how many times reporters would ask
the mayor at press conferences, why don’t you use that word?

  - archived recording (bill de blasio)  
    I don’t get lost in terminology. I think the notion of saying we
    have to diversify our schools is the best way to say it.

chana joffe-walt

I heard a live call-in show on WNYC, the public radio station. A young
integration advocate, an 11th grader named Tiffani Torres, asked the
mayor, how much longer until you do something?

  - archived recording (tiffani torres)  
    And how much more time do you need to study the issue? So to repeat
    my question, how much longer will it take?

  - archived recording (bill de blasio)  
    Tiffani, with all due respect, I really think you’re not hearing
    what we’re saying to you, so I’ll repeat it. There is a task force,
    an extraordinary task force, which I’ve met with. They are coming
    forward with their next report in a matter of weeks. So when that
    diversity task force comes out with their report, I think they’re
    amazing. I think they’ve done fantastic work. And so far, there’s a
    high level —

chana joffe-walt

Mayor de Blasio likes to point out that this was a problem created by
people long before him, which is exactly what people long before him
said, too.

\[music\]

In the late 1950s, when Black parents and civil rights activists also
asked the Board of Ed, why is it taking so long, board members
complained about the, quote, extremists who wanted instant integration.
Superintendent Jansen said, “some people want us to build Rome in one
day.” While the Board of Education was building Rome in 1956, ‘57, ‘59,
and in 1960, 1962, ‘63, Black parents found each other on PTAs, in civil
rights organizations, pro-integration groups. They formed new groups,
organized sit-ins, boycotts, demanded the Board provide a timetable for
citywide integration. They joined forces with Puerto Rican parents, and
their numbers grew. These were volunteers, mothers mostly, who left
their jobs at the end of a workday and headed directly to a meeting
about how to get the Board to give their kids the education white
children were already receiving. Finally, in 1964, 10 years after Brown
versus Board, Black and Puerto Rican parents said, enough. They were
sick of waiting, sick of lawsuits, sick of asking for a remedy, sick of
being ignored. So they went big, spectacularly big. They shut down the
schools. They organized a civil rights demonstration that was the
largest in US history, larger than the March on Washington. It was
called Freedom Day, a massive school boycott.

  - archived recording  
    (CHANTING) Freedom now\!

chana joffe-walt

On February 3rd, 1964, parents headed out to schools in the morning
before sunrise to spread the word about the boycott. It was freezing
cold that day. There’s a brief TV news clip of a group of mothers
picketing outside their kids’ school at the start of the school day.
They’re holding up signs that say, “we demand a real integration
timetable now,” and “integration means better schools for all.” They’re
handing out leaflets to other parents about Freedom Day, looking
spirited and cold. A white NBC news reporter in a fedora walks up to one
of the women.

  - archived recording  
    Ma’am, it’s a little after eight o’clock now. How successful has the
    boycott been so far? Very effective. So far, about 10 children have
    gone in, and there would be ordinarily 240 children. And 10 have
    gone into the morning session, which begins at eight o’clock. So you
    think you’ve already seen the result? Yes, I think so. The school is
    just empty. Does it surprise you? No, because we knew how effective
    — We talked with the parents. We distributed leaflets. We’ve been
    working very hard. And we prayed that it would be effective.

chana joffe-walt

There were maps and charts and instructions with picket times and picket
captains for hundreds of schools. There were volunteer shifts to make
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, to hand out thousands of leaflets
and stencil posters. The boycott wasn’t just effective — it was
extraordinarily effective. Half a million kids stayed home from school
that day. Half a million, close to half the school system. But the press
barely covered it. After searching every major TV network, I found only
one kid who was interviewed, a teenage boy, maybe around 16, on the
street with some friends, protesting. A white ABC News reporter doesn’t
ask him why he’s there. The only thing he asks him about is violence.
The kid responds.

  - archived recording  
    We’re coming down here today for a peaceful — peaceful— No comment\!
    No, we’re not going to be violent. We’re just teenagers and kids.
    And — Do you expect violence here today? No, sir, not if — look at
    the blue uniforms. You ask me do I expect violence.

He gestures to the police on horseback.

  - archived recording  
    None of us have any weapons, horses. And all we want is equal
    education. That’s all. Equal education. Thank you. You get all that?

chana joffe-walt

That was it. Every once in a while, I’ll hear a politician or friend or
school administrator say, yeah, integration was a good idea, but there
was no political will to make it happen. 460,000 kids, half the school
system. The will was there. The majority wanted integration.

\[music\]

After Freedom Day, the Board of Education introduced some small-scale
integration plans, and white parents protested. \[CHILDREN SINGING\] We
love our children. Oh, yes, we do. We will not transfer —

chana joffe-walt

With their own marches, they put on their own school boycott. The
flipside of freedom day, a white boycott. The white parents were far
fewer in number. But as far as I can tell, they got a thousand times
more press coverage.

  - archived recording  
    Mrs. Carcevski?

  - speaker  
    Yes? Are you going to send Johnny back to school now? No. She
    belongs here, and I want to send my child here. So nobody is going
    to tell me where to send my kid.

chana joffe-walt

This protest worked. The Board of Ed backed off. And in the decades
since, the Board of Education has never proposed a city-wide integration
plan. The schools have never been integrated. I think the fact of white
moms in Queens in the 1960s yelling about zoning changes and busing,
it’s not surprising they played a role in killing school integration
efforts. But there was another group of white parents who played a
quieter, but I’d argue more forceful, role in killing integration. The
white parents who said they supported it, parents like the ones who
wrote letters asking for an integrated I.S. 293. How did their vocal
support for integration turn lethal? That’s after the break. In the
American South, schools were desegregated with court orders. Cities and
counties mandated desegregation, and the schools desegregated. By the
early 1970s, the South was the most integrated region in the country.
But New York City did not want to do it that way. No mandates. The New
York City Board of Education wanted to appeal to hearts and minds. They
wanted to sell white people on the virtues of integration. Have it all
happen, quote, “naturally.” Some white people were sold. The white
parents who wrote letters about I.S. 293. They believed in integration.
So I made a lot of calls to ask, why’d you bail? They had a lot of
different reasons. One couple got divorced, and moved. Another guy told
me he had political ambitions that pulled him out of the city.

  - speaker  
    We loved our brownstone, but I was involved in a political race. And
    we needed some money for that.

chana joffe-walt

So he sold the house and moved the family to the suburbs, where he
thought he’d have a better chance running against Republicans. Many
white people moved to the suburbs for jobs, for newly paved roads and
subsidized mortgages, leaving Brooklyn behind. I understood what
happened there. But some explanations made less sense. Like one guy I
called, he did stay in Brooklyn. On the phone, he was telling me why he
believed it was important that I.S. 293 be integrated. But then he said
his own kids went to Brooklyn Friends, a Quaker private school. I said,
oh, they didn’t go to I.S. 293.

  - speaker  
    No. As I said, I’m a Quaker, and —

chana joffe-walt

But you were a Quaker when you wrote this letter, asking for an
integrated 293.

  - speaker  
    I believed it. I believed in it, but —

chana joffe-walt

You weren’t planning to send your kid there?

  - speaker  
    No, no, no.

chana joffe-walt

What to make of that? When you get what you say you want and then, given
the opportunity, don’t take it. Maybe you never really wanted it in the
first place. Then I spoke to Elaine Hencke. Of all the people I spoke
with, everything about Elaine indicated someone who did believe in
integration, someone who would send her kids to 293. And yet, she
didn’t. Elaine was a public school teacher. She taught in an
integrated elementary school, until she had her own kids. She was
looking forward to sending them to an integrated 293. When her daughter
was old enough for junior high school, Elaine visited the school. She
was the only letter writer I spoke with who actually went into the
building. If this was going to work with anyone, it was going to be
Elaine.

  - elaine hencke  
    I didn’t know quite what to make of it because the school had a nice
    plant. Physically, it was a nice school. But it just seemed chaotic
    and noisy, and kids were disruptive. And kids — \[LAUGHS\] — kids
    were doing the wrong things, you know? And kids do. I mean, it
    wasn’t that they were nasty kids or doing — it was not drugs. It
    was not drugs. It was just — it just seemed too chaotic to me at the
    time.

chana joffe-walt

Elaine and I talked for a long time I pushed her — not to make her feel
bad, but to get to what felt like a more real answer. At the time that
you are visiting, was it majority Black and Hispanic kids?

  - elaine hencke  
    Yes, I’m sure it was.

chana joffe-walt

And did that have anything to do with the way that you saw the classroom
as disruptive and chaotic?

  - elaine hencke  
    I would hope not.
    
    I’m not — I’m not sure how well educated they were, or — you know, I
    don’t know. I don’t know why I’m going into this.

chana joffe-walt

Well, did you have reason to think that they weren’t well educated?

  - elaine hencke  
    Before 293? Well, their reading levels were way down. You know.

chana joffe-walt

I’m just — when you say chaos and disruptive, I’m trusting that what you
saw was chaotic and disruptive. But I also know that those are words
white people use — we use to express our racial fears, to express real
racial fears. Do you think that’s what was happening with you?

  - elaine hencke  
    I don’t think I would admit to that. I don’t think that was true.
    But what I may have thought was that these kids are not expected to
    do so well in school, all the way from the beginning of school. And
    here they are, really unprepared in some way, for junior high school
    or — I mean, the reading levels were low.

chana joffe-walt

Elaine told me when she wrote that letter to the Board of Education, she
pictured her children becoming friends with Black kids, learning
side-by-side, learning that all children are equal. That’s what
motivated her to write that letter. She wanted the picture of
integration the Board of Ed was promoting — the picture of harmonious
integration. But when she visited I.S. 293, that didn’t seem possible.
The reading levels were low. The kids were not entering the school on
equal grounds. Her white children had received years of high quality
teaching at well-resourced schools. The kids coming from segregated
elementary schools had not had that experience.

  - elaine hencke  
    I mean, one of the problems is that many of the white kids had
    higher sort of academic skills, or skills. They could read better. I
    think — I mean, if the white kids knew how to read in first grade
    and — and I guess there were Black kids who also could. But it just
    seemed as if most of the black kids didn’t really learn — learn to
    read.

chana joffe-walt

But part of the — part of the vocal complaints of black parents at this
period of time was that their kids were not learning how to read because
schools were segregated, and their kids were kept in schools that were
inferior. And that was part of the argument for integration.

  - elaine hencke  
    Yes, yes.

chana joffe-walt

That their kids were not going to get the resources, and quality
teaching, and good facilities unless they were in the same buildings
with kids like yours.

  - elaine hencke  
    Right.
    
    I don’t know what to say to that. I just — I guess I just began to
    feel that things were really difficult for these kids. Schools were
    not made for them. If the schools were made for them, with their
    background, what would they be like?
    
    I think there was — and that’s another whole thing. I don’t know
    about it. I think there was sort of anger in the black community at
    the white community. A lot of the teachers were white. There were
    more white teachers, I suppose. People said that that was racism.
    And of course, it was racism. But maybe the kids were a little angry
    at the school. I wouldn’t — I couldn’t fault them for that. But on
    the other hand, then they don’t get as much from the school. I don’t
    know. I thought the problems were kind of enormous. And I guess I
    just, at one point, I just decided that my kids should go — went to
    Brooklyn Friends. And we could afford to pay for it. It wasn’t easy,
    you know. It was — \[LAUGHS\] but —

chana joffe-walt

Did your feelings about integration change? Did you believe in it less?

  - elaine hencke  
    Maybe.
    
    I think I would have said no, theoretically. But maybe they did. I
    guess I saw it as a more difficult project then. I sort of did back
    off from it. I just —

chana joffe-walt

Yeah. It felt when you guys wrote these letters like, this is —
integration is this exciting ideal, and we can be part of it, and it’s
going to be a meaningful project that’s also going to be kind of easy.

  - elaine hencke  
    I certainly didn’t think it would be so difficult. But I — I was, I
    was innocent, you know? I don’t know. I still believe in it. I do.

\[music\]

chana joffe-walt

I think what Elaine actually meant was not that she was innocent, but
that she was naive. She was naive about the reality of segregation, the
harm of it. And naive about what it would take to undo it. She did not
know. And I think she didn’t want to know. When Elaine said the word
innocent, I felt a jolt of recognition. I felt like Elaine had walked me
right up to the truth about her, and about me.

When my own kids were old enough, I sent them to our zoned public
school. It was racially mixed and economically mixed. I was excited
about that. And it was nice walking to school with neighbors, people I
likely never would have gotten to know otherwise. My kid’s first day of
school was another boy’s first week in the country. He’d just moved from
China, and his mom asked the neighbor where the school was. When she
said goodbye that first morning, I think he thought I was a teacher, and
he crawled into my lap. We had no words in common, so I just held him
while he screamed and cried. By the holiday show three months later, I
watched that same boy belt out “This Pretty Planet” on a stage with his
classmates. He was the star. He nailed the hand motions. Every other kid
up on stage was just following his lead, just trying to keep up. It was
such a sweet picture, all of them up there — Black kids, and Mexican
kids, and Colombian, and Asian and white kids. And all of us adults
supporting all of them. It’s moving, to me, this picture of integration.
It is also, I’m realizing right now, writing these words down, the very
same picture the Board of Education put forth in 1954 — a multiracial
choir singing together, building brotherhood. And it’s dangerous, I
think, this picture of integration. It seems perfectly designed to
preserve my innocence, to make me comfortable, not to remedy inequality,
but a way to bypass it entirely. I can sit in that assembly and feel
good about the gauzy display of integration without ever being asked to
think about the fact that much of the time, white kids in the school
building are having a different educational experience than kids of
color. A large share of the white students at the school are clustered
in a gifted program. They have separate classrooms and separate
teachers. We all blithely call these white children gifted and talented,
G\&T, starting at four years old. White children are performing better
at the school than black children and Latino children. White families
are the loudest and most powerful voices in the building. The advantages
white kids had back in the 1950s, they’re still in place. When Elaine
said she was innocent, I thought about the things we say, nice, white
parents, to each other about why we won’t send our kids to segregated
schools — because they’re too strict, or too chaotic, or too disruptive.
Because the test scores are bad, because we want more play. We want
fewer worksheets. Because we don’t want to ride a bus. We don’t want
uniforms. We don’t want tests. We want innocence. We need it, to protect
us from the reality that we are the ones creating the segregation, and
we’re not sure we’re ready to give it up.

\[music\]

Elaine was not for segregation. But in the end, she wasn’t really for
integration, either. All of the choices she made, choices she had the
luxury of making, were meant to advantage her own kids. And I understand
that. That’s what parents do.

  - elaine  
    I remember thinking very clearly that OK, I believe in this. But I
    don’t sort of want to sacrifice my children to it. I have to look at
    what they will learn, and what they will do. And for people who sent
    their kids to 293, it seemed to work out well. So that made me
    think, well, maybe I made a mistake. Maybe they should have gone
    there. I know at one point it was very clear to me that I had
    beliefs that I thought were kind of contrary to my own children’s
    best interests. And I decided that I wasn’t going to use them to
    sort of extend my own beliefs. But then I regretted that, because
    that wasn’t really true.

chana joffe-walt

You regretted what?

  - elaine  
    Well, I kind of wish I had sent them to 293 because Joan’s kids had
    a good experience there.

chana joffe-walt

Elaine’s friend Joan, another white mom who did send her kids to I.S.
293. Elaine still feels bad about her choice. But not everyone felt bad.

  - carol netzer  
    We were not pious, kind of, oh, the kids have to go to public
    school. Not at all. I went to public schools, and there’s nothing to
    write about.

chana joffe-walt

Carol is the woman who wrote the letter about how she’d come to New York
City from the suburbs for integration. I had a hard time reconciling her
lack of piety with her letter, which I read back to her, about wanting
her kids to mix freely with children of other classes and races.
\[READING\] — which we were not able to provide for them when we lived
in the Westchester suburb.

  - carol netzer  
    That was all true. Yeah, yeah.

chana joffe-walt

You remember feeling that way?

  - carol netzer  
    Well, I don’t really remember feeling that way. And I think that we
    say a lot of things that are politically correct, without even
    realizing that we are not telling exactly how we feel. So I can’t
    really guarantee that it was 100% the way I felt. I don’t really
    remember. Probably close to it, but I mean, I’m a liberal, you know?

chana joffe-walt

As a parent, did you — do you remember feeling like, I hope my kid has
experiences outside of just people like them?

  - carol netzer  
    Not especially. I mean, we rushed right away to send them to private
    school, right? So what was most important to us was that they get
    the best education. But one of the things that changed it was St.
    Anne’s School, a sort of progressive school with this man,
    headmaster, who was brilliant. Opened up St. Anne’s. And if you keep
    working on this, you’ll hear a lot about St. Anne’s.

chana joffe-walt

I’m not going to tell you a lot about St. Anne’s, except to say this —
it’s one of the most prominent private schools in Brooklyn. Upscale
neighborhood, prime real estate, lots of heavy-hitters send their kids
to St. Anne’s. I had heard of it. What I didn’t know is that St. Anne’s
opened at the very same time that Black parents were waging their
strongest fight for integration in New York City, in 1965. Right when a
lot of the letter writers would have been looking for schools. And it
wasn’t just St. Anne’s. New progressive private schools were opening and
expanding all over the city. Brooklyn Friends School expanded into a new
building, and would double its enrollment. They were opening private
schools in the South, too. But down there, it was all very explicit.
They became known as quote, unquote, “segregation academies,” schools
for white people who were wholeheartedly committed to avoiding
integration. In the North, private schools opened as if they were
completely disconnected from everything else that was happening at that
very moment. St. Anne’s marketed itself as a pioneer, a community of
like-minded, gifted kids, no grades. Lots of talk about progressive,
child-centered education, the whole child. At one point in my
conversation with Carol Netzer I was talking about how integration was
happening around his time. And she surprised me by saying, no, not at
that time.

  - carol netzer  
    I think the — I think that you may be off on the timing for me,
    because it was too early. They didn’t start really any kind of
    crusade about integrating until well after I had left the
    neighborhood.

chana joffe-walt

No, they were integrating the schools in the ‘60s, though.

  - carol netzer  
    Oh. It didn’t make much of a splash. We weren’t against it. There
    was — it wasn’t a big item.

chana joffe-walt

That’s how easy it was to walk away from integration in New York City.
You could do it without even knowing you’d thrown a bomb over your
shoulder on the way out.

\[music\]

Here is what I think happened over those five years between the writing
of the letters in 1963 and not sending their kids to the school in 1968.
Those five years were a battle between the Board of Education’s
definition of integration and the actual integration that black parents
wanted. For black parents, integration was about safe schools for their
children, with qualified teachers and functioning toilets, a full day of
school. For them, integration was a remedy for injustice. The Board of
Ed, though, took that definition and retooled it. Integration wasn’t a
means to an end. It was about racial harmony and diversity. The Board
spun integration into a virtue that white parents could feel good about.
And their side triumphed. That’s the definition of integration that
stuck, that’s still with us today. It’s the version of integration that
was being celebrated 50 years later, at the French Cultural Services
Building at the Gala for SAS.

In some of my calls with the white letter writers, a few people
mentioned that yes, they wanted integration. But also, they wanted the
school closer to them. They weren’t comfortable sending their kids over
to the other side of the neighborhood. Which brings me to one final
letter from the other side of the neighborhood. One I haven’t told you
about, from the I.S. 293 folder in the archives. It’s one of the only
letters, as far as I can tell, that is not from a white parent. It’s
from the Tenants Association for the Gowanus Houses, a housing project,
home to mostly Black and Puerto Rican families. They also wanted a
school closer to them. The letter from the Tenants Association is formal
and straightforward. It says, please build the school on the original
site you proposed, right next to the projects. That way, they explained,
our kids won’t have to cross many streets. We’ll get recreational
facilities, which we desperately need. And it’ll be close to the people
who will actually use it. The letter says they represent over 1,000
families. The white families, they numbered a couple dozen. Still, in
the name of integration, the white letter writers got what they wanted —
a new building close to where they lived, that they did not attend. Note
the Black and Puerto Rican families we’re not asking to share a school
with white people. They were not seeking integration. That’s not what
their letter was about. They were asking for a school, period. The
school they got was three blocks further than they wanted. And from the
moment it opened, I.S. 293 was de facto segregated — an overwhelmingly
Black and Puerto Rican school. What were those years like, once the
white parents pushing their priorities went away? Once there were no
more efforts at feel-good integration, and the community was finally
left alone? Was that better? That’s next time, on “Nice White Parents.”

chana joffe-walt

I.S. 293 opened in 1968. Renee Flowers was part of the first generation
of students to walk in the door.

renee flowers

And you’re talking about the building on Court Street. I went to school
there. It was nice. And it was brand new. It was nice.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Were you nervous about going?

  - renee flowers  
    Because all your friends — all your friends from the neighborhood
    was there.

chana joffe-walt

The Gowanus neighborhood where Renee grew up, and still lives — the
housing project’s three blocks away from the school. Renee went to I.S.
293, graduated. And she kept going back to the building to play
handball, to vote, to attend graduations. Renee coaches the neighborhood
drill team, and they’d perform at the school. For years, she’d regularly
go watch the basketball tournament. Renee is in her 60s. She’s just
retired from the post office. The school has been a fixture for most of
her life. She knows every part of the building.

  - renee flowers  
    Actually, if you go in on the Baltic Street entrance, the school
    safety sitting. Then when you walk actually into the building, the
    auditorium is right to your right.

chana joffe-walt

As we we’re talking, she closes her eyes. She can see it.

  - renee flowers  
    Walk up a little more and turn left. And another left, the gym is
    right there. I know exactly where everything is — the cafeteria —

chana joffe-walt

Renee has this stack of old I.S. 293 yearbooks in her apartment — even
the years she wasn’t a student there.

She’ll take the yearbooks out for Gowanus Old Timers Day every August.
Renee is Black. She has never wondered why I.S. 293 is located on Court
Street; why they all had to walk to the edge of the white neighborhood
to get to school. She never heard about the battle over where the
building would be located or the white parents who wanted a fringe
school. Renee just knew the school was theirs. Imani Gayle Gillison told
me the same thing — 293 was ours.

  - imani gayle gillison  
    White folks were going to 29 or somewhere else. I don’t where they
    went really, but they weren’t even at 293. So we didn’t even see
    them.

chana joffe-walt

Imani was very eager to talk about 293, which I found charming because
she didn’t even go there. She says she was one of the only Gowanus kids
whose parents entered a Catholic school, and she’s never forgotten it.
She was so jealous of her brothers, all her friends at I.S. 293. They
called it I.S. or Nathan Hale Junior High School. The kids would all
walk home together in a big group. And Imani remembers seeing them in
their green Nathan Hale sweaters, hearing them sing the Nathan Hale
school song.

  - imani gayle gillison  
    There was a pride in their school. They would sometimes be singing
    it on the way home and stuff.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Really?

  - imani gayle gillison  
    Yeah.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Little 10-year-old boys?

  - imani gayle gillison  
    \[LAUGHS\] Yeah, really. That was their anthem. (SINGING) in the
    Continental Army was a soldier of renown. Nathan Hale, his name was
    known to be. He was captured by the British in a lone, lone England
    town, so he died for his own country. So he died for his own country
    to keep his —

chana joffe-walt

From Serial Productions, I’m Chana Joffe-Walt. This is “Nice White
Parents.” We’re telling the story of one public school building to see
if it’s possible to create a school that is equal and integrated. This
episode — what if we dropped the integrated part?

\[music\]

I was talking to an academic recently, a sociologist and writer who
studies education, a Black woman named Eve Ewing. I was telling her what
I was working on. And at some point in the conversation, she asked me,
why are you so obsessed with integration? It threw me. I guess I’m
obsessed with integration because it feels like an obvious goal. It’s
the best way to equalize schools, empirically in terms of test scores
and outcomes. But also, segregation is antithetical to the American
promise — life, liberty. Segregation is anathema to all of that. It’s
caste. But after seeing what happened at SIS, the year the new white
families came in, and after learning about how the school was founded on
a false ideal of integration, how unreliable white families were, how
they paid no attention to the actual voices and needs of families of
color, I don’t know. Why expend energy chasing white people who don’t
actually want to participate or don’t even show up? Maybe it’s better to
set aside integration entirely and focus instead on the kids who do show
up. For decades after it opened, I.S. 293 was largely a segregated
school. There weren’t any white parents pushing their wispy ideas of
integration. The school was pretty much left alone. I’d seen what
happens when nice white parents came inside the building. Was it better
when they stayed out?

To start, I should say that I.S. 293 was not an experiment in Black
self-governance. There were schools like that opening all over the
country — schools founded on the premise that you didn’t need white
families to get a good education. Integration was not the answer. These
schools focused on Black power. They developed afrocentric curricula and
insisted on people of color in leadership positions. I.S. 293 was not
that. It was a pretty average 1970s public school. The principal was
white. The teachers were almost all white. The local community school
board, also white. The kids were Black and brown. There were always some
white kids at 293, but they were a small minority. I wanted to know —
was I.S. 293 a good school back then? There wasn’t much in the official
record — some math and writing scores that weren’t great. But aside from
that, there was curiously little written about the school. Most schools
show up here and there in the archive or in news reports — not 293.
which could mean everything was going just fine. Or it could mean the
school was falling apart. I found names of some I.S. 293 alumni in
Renee’s yearbooks.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Was it a good school?

  - speaker  
    I don’t really remember. I think I was one of the first ones to wear
    pants.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    You were one of the first girls to wear pants?

  - speaker  
    Yeah, underneath a skirt. \[LAUGHTER\]

chana joffe-walt

The pants have nothing to do with how the school was. It’s just what she
members of this time in her life. She wanted to wear pants. I had a lot
of conversations like this. People had fond memories of I.S. 293. People
had sad memories. But mostly, they had very specific memories.

  - rspeaker  
    Jomar Brandon — yeah, he was like the basketball superstar back
    then. I just thought he was the cutest thing ever.

chana joffe-walt

I heard about the song that was on repeat the summer before 7th grade,
the lighting in the basement, Mr. Barringer, the scary dean, whom
everyone called big head Barringer. One I.S. 293 graduate told me what
she remembered was a teacher who used her long nails to eat pumpkin
seeds in class. I met Sheila Saunders at a barbecue by the Gowanus
Houses. She went to 293, so did all of her siblings, friends, nearly
everyone else at this barbecue.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Was 293 a good school?

  - sheila saunders  
    293 was — I would say it was good because I had nothing to compare
    it to. That was the local school that we had to go to. So what do we
    use to rate it?

chana joffe-walt

Was I.S. 293 a good school during this period of time? The more I asked
it, I recognized what a modern-day question that is. This is the way we
talk about public schools now — good schools and bad schools. At I.S.
293, there was no school choice. Every neighborhood was zoned to its
designated middle school. Apart from the white families, most everyone
from the community was there — middle class, working class, poor kids,
Black kids, hispanic, dorky, goofy, arty kids. Everyone went. I.S. 293
wasn’t good or bad; it was just school. And then something happened at
I.S. 293. When I was looking through the Board of Ed archives, the year
1984 stood out. It’s the year I.S. 293 starts showing up in the records.
That year, a few parents from the school began asking the district
superintendent for an investigation into the local community school
board. One person, writing on behalf of the 293 Parent Association,
suggests an investigation is critical because the board is planning in
secret to harm the school. The board, this person says, is, quote,
“controlled by people who are out for the real estate interest and
have little regard for minorities.” Another parent writes, they’re
unhappy with the local school board because it has, quote, “ceased to
act in the best interest of our children.” I couldn’t really understand
from the archive exactly what these parents we’re talking about. The
first person I thought to ask was Dolores Hadden Smith. So many 293
alumni mentioned Ms. Smith. Ms. Smith worked at 293 longer than anyone
else I talked to — 42 years.

  - dolores hadden smith  
    Everybody’s name — I knew everybody’s name. They said, Ms. Smith was
    my teacher. And the kids — in the projects would say, Ms. Smith was
    everybody’s teacher. I know them by name. I have their addresses.

chana joffe-walt

She grew up in the neighborhood. Her mom worked at the school, her
sister, her brother.

  - dolores hadden smith  
    I called their parents right from the classroom. Our community, we
    were like one big family.

chana joffe-walt

Ms. Smith told me everything was fine. And then in the ‘80s, they
started messing with us, started messing with who they sent to our
school.

  - dolores hadden smith  
    I can’t say why. It’s just that you noticed it. It was blatant. You
    could see it for yourself. Nobody had to tell you that.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    How could you see it? What made it possible?

  - dolores hadden smith  
    Because the children they were putting in there were
    lower-functioning children. They weren’t at the top, the creme de la
    creme. They wasn’t those children anymore.

chana joffe-walt

There’s a local news article from 1987 where the principal of 293 says
the same thing. He accuses the district of, quote, “skimming off the
high-achieving students from his school,” specifically poaching white
students. Ms. Smith says that just started disappearing.

  - dolores hadden smith  
    And they were offered, behind the curtain, other options that you
    could go to the places that maybe some of the other children weren’t
    afforded the chance to go.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    So there would be options for white kids that seemed like they were
    happening in —

  - dolores hayden-smith  
    Well, I know they offered some of the children positions that they
    could take, as opposed to come into our building. I know the
    Caucasian kids were offered other things. They started encouraging
    them to go other places, as opposed to coming to our school. And
    they’re behind closed doors. And they never come out and just say
    it.

\[music\]

chana joffe-walt

OK. So there was something happening behind closed doors, and the local
community school board was part of it. I took these claims to Norm
Fruchter. He was on the local school board around this time; although, I
figured it was unlikely he’d say, why, yes, we did have a secret plot to
steal 293’s high-achievers and white kids. And yet, that is basically
what he said.

  - norm fruchter  
    There was a lot of trepidation, particularly at the middle school
    level, as to whether white parents would stay.

chana joffe-walt

Norm says white parents had left his district in the 1970s. They left
the public schools entirely or moved out of the city. Black families
were also leaving in large numbers, but the school board was completely
preoccupied by the white flight. Norm says board members saw a decline
in white students as a serious threat.

  - norm fruchter  
    They equated that with school quality. If you lost white students,
    your achievement levels would go down, right? Your schools would be
    less attractive places for teachers to come into because when they
    thought teachers, they thought white teachers and a whole bunch of
    spillover effects would happen — what the graduation rates would
    look like.

chana joffe-walt

Their solution? A gifted program.

  - norm fruchter  
    The district started the program explicitly to maintain a white
    population.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    That was the explicit goal?

  - norm fruchter  
    That was explicit because the unspoken assumption of the
    administration in our district and every district was that if you
    had a gifted program, it would attract white parents.

chana joffe-walt

To get into gifted programs, you had to take a test. Gifted kids would
be taught in separate classrooms. They opened gifted programs in select
elementary schools. And a new gifted program opened in a different
middle school, a school called M.S. 51. This is part of what the people
at I.S. 293 were seeing. Their strongest students were being siphoned
off. White parents, even when they were not inside 293, were beginning
to change the school.

  - norm fruchter  
    Because what you were creating was a predominantly white track
    within the schools, and their kids would get in, no matter what kind
    of testing you used.

\[music\]

Parents who were committed to getting their kids in the gifted program
could do it.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    White parents?

  - norm fruchter  
    Yeah.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    And what about non-white parents who were committed to getting their
    kids into the gifted program?

  - norm fruchter  
    Well, what you had to also deal with there was a fair amount of bias
    in the testing administration.

chana joffe-walt

Norm says there were kids of color who were clearly qualified, but were
not in the gifted program. And he says this was because the questions
were biased, and the people administering the tests were sometimes
biased. He also says parents were hiring their own psychologists to test
their children and paying for test prep. But also, there was another
reason Black and Latino kids were not in the gifted program.

  - nadine jackson  
    I was a nerd — yes. I was an honor student.

chana joffe-walt

Nadine Jackson might have been one of those kids who would have
qualified as gifted. She was a student at I.S. 293, a Black kid from the
Gowanus Projects.

  - nadine jackson  
    I was never absent — math honor roll all the time. I was on the
    dean’s list. I mean, I was that nerdy child. I’ve always wanted to
    be a professional. I’ve always wanted to be someone of importance.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    You’ve always wanted to be someone of importance?

  - nadine jackson  
    Always, always. I wanted to be an actress or a teacher.

chana joffe-walt

Nadine was not kept out of the gifted program because of bias or lack of
test prep. She simply had never heard of the program. She went to the
school everyone else went to. She started seventh grade at I.S. 293 in
1993. And Nadine was eager to jump in — ready to be delivered to
importance with hard work which she put in. Nadine studied computer
technology. She played first clarinet in the band. She played Whitney
Houston, “I Have Nothing” on clarinet over and over. In her first year,
the I.S. 293 band went to perform at another middle school nearby — M.S.
51, the school with the gifted program. When Nadine arrived there, she
walked right into an experience a lot of kids have when they leave their
school and enter a world of wealthier kids.

  - nadine jackson  
    We were amazed at just the way they operate was completely
    different. They had a huge orchestra there. We had a small one here.
    And we were just amazed how they would just outshine us. I mean,
    they have better resources. They have better equipment. They have
    better instruments. Everything was top-notch. And us, it was more
    like second-class hand me downs.

chana joffe-walt

M.S. 51 and I.S. 293 were in the same school district. They were
governed by the same local community school board, and they were a mile
and half away from each other. When I asked Nadine the same question I
had asked previous graduates of I.S. 293, what was the school like, she
described the feeling of being trapped. She told me, it was normal at
293 to have 42 kids in a class. She said teachers came and went
frequently in the middle of the school year. She had six or seven social
studies teachers in one year. I was skeptical about the numbers, but I
looked into it. And all of this seems entirely plausible for those
years. There was a recession. School budgets were decimated. In 1991,
New York City proposed 250 million dollars in educational spending cuts.
In 1992, 600 million. School programs are being cut mid-year; class
sizes ballooned; teachers were moved around, a lot. At the same time,
Nadine’s district was supporting gifted programs, bussing white kids out
of their zoned schools, hiring separate teachers, administering special
tests, running an entirely separate educational track. At M.S. 51, the
gifted middle school, there were not 40 plus kids in a class; there were
30. The school was written up in a book from the 1990s called “New York
City’s Best Public Middle Schools.” It describes the school’s leaders as
masters at developing faculty, talent and enthusiasm. The M.S. 51
principal is quoted saying, “when we started the gifted program, we got
parents who were more involved, more inquisitive.” He then goes on to
say, “the gifted program shifted his whole educational approach. It made
him recognize that children in early adolescence need close contact with
nurturing adults.” And he began to hire teachers who he saw as, quote,
“warm and comforting.” I.S. 293 and M.S. 51 were both public middle
schools. But that day she visited M.S. 51, Nadine felt like this school
— this is the school that’s preparing kids to be someone of
importance.

  - nadine jackson  
    The education system is better.
    
    The way they talked is different. They were so smart. The children
    there, they were taking their Regents at a very early stage.

chana joffe-walt

Regents are state tests kids normally take in high school.

  - nadine jackson  
    Then it’s like, oh, my goodness, the way that students carry
    themselves was different, as if they knew something that we didn’t
    know. Like, they had a secret we didn’t know of. And when were we
    going to find out?

chana joffe-walt

After Nadine’s out at M.S. 51, she says it made her see her own school
differently. I.S. 293, to her, looked like a school for chumps.

  - nadine jackson  
    This is where we all went. That’s what we knew. That’s what our
    parents knew. It really makes you wonder, do we even have a chance?
    You’re tying to figure out who you are. How do I fit in to society?
    Where do I put myself? That was hard. It made me feel dumb in a
    sense. I didn’t know anything.

chana joffe-walt

In the 1980s when the district started grading specialized programs at
other schools, I.S. 293 parents fought back. But Norm Fruchter, the
school board member, told me once the gifted programs were in place,
they were there to stay. The board was serving a constituency of white
parents who believed their kids deserved a program to serve their unique
needs. And he says, those parents wielded tremendous power.

  - norm fruchter  
    There were huge pitch fights in the school board meetings whenever
    we put a resolution on the agenda to change the gifted program. They
    could mobilize 500 people for a meeting. So you could fill an
    elementary school auditorium with gifted program parents, or, as we
    used to say the district, gifted parents, as if somehow the —

  - chana joffe-walt  
    The giftedness got passed up toward them?

  - norm fruchter  
    Yeah. And they called themselves that as well. And one of the many
    things they argued was that it was important to maintain the white
    population in the gifted program in order to have some semblance of
    integration in the schools, and that there were benefits that would
    flow from the gifted program to the rest of the school.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Who argued that? The parents?

  - norm fruchter  
    Yes.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    The gifted parents?

  - norm fruchter  
    Yeah. Yeah. \[LAUGHS\]

chana joffe-walt

They argued that the gifted program, designed to serve white families,
was actually an integration program, when, in fact, it was a separate
track in the school that kept Black and brown kids from resources from
special programs, which is what segregation was designed to do — to
separate. This was its latest adaptation, and it wasn’t the last. That’s
after the break.

1994, about halfway through I.S. 293’s 60-year history, and here’s where
things stood — 293 did not have any white parents messing with things
inside of the building. But white families in the district were drawing
resources away from I.S. 293 by creating specialty gifted programs in
other schools. I.S. 293 was separate and increasingly unequal. And that
is when Judi Aronson enters the scene — a woman who is not connected to
I.S. 293, but was about to be. History is about to repeat itself.

  - judi aronson  
    My daughter was in third or fourth grade, and I felt that there was
    not a viable middle school for her.

chana joffe-walt

At the same time, Nadine, the nerdy honor roll student was starting
junior high school at 293, Judi had a daughter who was finishing
elementary school. Judi’s daughter was zoned for M.S. 51, the school
with the gifted program, but Judi wasn’t excited about that school.

  - judi aronson  
    It was a big school, very traditional, not a very exciting
    curriculum, fairly segregated because it had a segregated gifted
    program that was mostly white. And then the kids of color were in
    the mainstream at that time. And we wanted something a little
    different. We wanted another option for our kids.

chana joffe-walt

Judi had been a special ed teacher in a public school. Then she left the
classroom and started working at the Teachers Union, the UFT. Later, she
became a school principal and a superintendent. So she’d spent a lot of
time thinking about schools — what makes a school successful. And she’d
begun to imagine what it would look like to build something better.

  - judi aronson  
    I had this idea. I was born in Hungary. And then I lived in Vienna,
    and I grew up in Montreal. And I lived in Brooklyn for the last 46
    years. And we’ve traveled a lot, my husband and I. And I’m a firm
    believer that you learn so much about the world through other
    people, through talking to them through a variety of cultures. So
    the idea behind the school was that kids would have exchanges.

chana joffe-walt

Judi got a group of parents together, a planning committee.

  - judi aronson  
    They wanted something, a school that was diverse, that was
    child-centered, that had a progressive, innovative curriculum,
    small, student-centered, all the buzz words — excellent teachers,
    not a large school where kids would learn a second language, not the
    way they learn it now, but a lot better, where they would learn
    about different cultures, all those ideas.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    How much was diversity a part of it?

  - judi aronson  
    I think it was very, very much a part of it. And I’m thinking of our
    planning committee. I don’t think it was very diverse now looking
    back on it.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Why did you guys want the school to be diverse? why? was that
    central to what you were doing?

  - judi aronson  
    Well, we all stayed in the city for a reason. And we didn’t want — I
    mean, one of the reasons that we didn’t like 51 is that segregation
    of the gifted kids being all white and the rest of the school being
    children of color. So we want it diverse, and I wanted my kids to
    really be accepting of everyone.

\[music\]

chana joffe-walt

The planning committee put together a 13-page proposal for a new school
called the Brooklyn School for Global Citizenship. The local community
school board approve it; although, somewhere in the process they dropped
the citizenship part — too controversial — and it became the Brooklyn
School for Global Studies. OK. So, why am I telling you about the School
for Global Studies? Because this brand new school needed a building —
the community school board surveyed its options and chose a spot. The
School for Global Studies would be located in the basement of I.S. 293.

  - nadine jackson  
    One day it was like, you’re going to get another school in your
    building. And we were like, how is that possible? Where? How? We
    only have three floors, and it’s barely enough for us.

chana joffe-walt

Nadine was in eighth grade when this happened, September 1994, and she
was not into this idea.

  - nadine jackson  
    You want to put a new school in, and yet you have 43 kids in a
    classroom. Why? How about you make these classrooms a little bit
    smaller and get more teachers in before you put it in new school? I
    mean, I’m a big advocate of let’s fix the problem first before you
    want to add onto things.

chana joffe-walt

An article in the New York Times proclaimed, a miracle of a school
opened its doors this fall in Brooklyn, thanks to determined parents
who’ve created with the new principal called, quote, “the Taj Mahal of
education.” Global Studies had class sizes as small as 18 kids. The
curriculum included trips to museums. The students went outdoors to
learn, measured shadows for math. They dug in soil for science
experiments. The students at 293 saw all of that, as they went about
their days at the not Taj Mahal of education, and they were pissed.

  - nadine jackson  
    You’re in our lunchroom. You’re in our gym. You’re in our school
    yard. And it was like, where did these people come from? Where did
    the school come from? How was this even possible? This is our
    school. This is our neighborhood. How dare you?

chana joffe-walt

Whenever Nadine or the other 293 kids walked by the global studies
classes, they’d make sure to bang on the classroom doors. And the 293
teachers and staff, school security officers, the custodian, the
principal, they didn’t welcome the new school for global cities either.
I heard stories from this time about the staff from Global Studies
asking to put up student work in the hallways and being told by the
long-time 293 custodian, you can’t. That’s a fire hazard. Global Studies
wanted to use the auditorium for a performance — sorry, it’s occupied.
And I heard this story from the Global Studies principal, a guy named
Larry Abrams, who’d been hired to lead what, to him, sounded like such
an exciting new school, and then he showed up to work.

  - larry abrams  
    The first day there — or not the first day, the first week, the two
    school cops came down, put me in handcuffs. I said, what? But they
    were joking. They were going to arrest me because I was taking over
    space in the building.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - larry abrams  
    \[CHUCKLES\] And now I think about it, it’s pretty funny, but —

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Wait, wait, wait. The school security came down and were like,
    you’re —

  - larry abrams  
    The police department — you’re under arrest. \[LAUGHS\]

  - chana joffe-walt  
    This is like the first week of the school?

  - larry abrams  
    Yeah. I forgot — the first or the second week. I mean, but
    obviously, we weren’t welcomed in the place, and it was going to be
    a battle.

chana joffe-walt

Remember how I said history repeats itself?

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Oh, your kid didn’t go to Global Studies.

  - judi aronson  
    No, no because it took forever.

chana joffe-walt

Judi Aronson did not end up sending her daughter to Global because by
the time it opened, her daughter was already in middle school. When her
younger son was old enough for middle school, a couple of years later,
she didn’t send him either.

  - judi aronson  
    So I sent him to a new small school in Sheepshead Bay.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Oh, wow. Wait, you sent him to a small school that was not the small
    school that you made.

  - judi aronson  
    No. Not the small school that I made — no.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    So your kids didn’t even get to go to the school that you created.

  - judi aronson  
    No, no. And it had a lot of rough — don’t ask.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    I am going to ask you about that.

  - judi aronson  
    Oh, my god, the school ran into a lot of problems. There were too
    many challenges. The kids were difficult the teachers had issues.
    None of us sent our kids there.

chana joffe-walt

This is not entirely true. I did speak with one parent from the planning
committee who sent her son to Global Studies. Although, she said when
they showed up in September, it looked to her like he was the only white
boy in the school. She said he had a good experience there. Judi decided
what was best for her kids was something else.

\[music\]

In an effort to appease white parents, the school district had once
again made a choice that sidelined 293. White parents had said jump, so
the district jumped. And now they were left trying to fill the school
for Global Studies, a school that had no obvious constituency. Most of
the parents who created it didn’t send their kids, and the neighborhood
kids already had a school — I.S. 293. This meant, to fill Global
Studies, the district had to find kids who weren’t happy at their
schools, or kids whose schools weren’t unhappy with them. Or they had to
bank on families randomly applying to a school they’d never heard of.

  - judi aronson  
    It’s one thing if a student says, I want to go to this school
    because this is what I’m passionate about. OK? But that did not
    happen. So it became a place where they placed kids that were
    difficult. They were challenging — very, very challenging.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    They were acting out when they showed up?

  - judi aronson  
    Yes.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Well, they were in a school that wasn’t designed for them.

  - judi aronson  
    That’s true, 100% true.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    That had this whole vision that had nothing to do with the kids who
    were there.

  - judi aronson  
    Yeah, Yeah. Yep.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Did you feel bad about that?

  - judi aronson  
    Yes. I mean, yes. Yes, I did — that we had these great ideas and not
    everything came to fruition. Yes, we opened up a school, but it
    wasn’t exactly everything we thought it would be.

chana joffe-walt

Within six or seven years, most of the original Global Studies staff had
left, including the principal. Within a decade, nobody knew why the
school was called Global Studies in the first place. Global Studies
became a regular segregated public school, which shared a building with
another segregated public school.

\[music\]

In my experience, schools are immune to long-term memory. They get new
principals, new names, a new generation of parents. And they’re
populated by children who have no reason to care about what came before
— clean slate every September. This, I believe, is also what makes it
possible for us to keep repeating the same story. We constantly reset
the clock and move forward. When we look to diagnose the problems of our
public schools, we look at what is in front of us right now. We look
forward. Nobody looks backwards to history. And so the question is not
how do we stop white families from hoarding all the resources. Instead,
the question is, what’s going on with the Black kids? This became the
question driving the next era at I.S. 293, the latest era of school
reform — the mid 1990s right up to today, a time when business people
and American presidents and tech company billionaires committed
themselves to solving the problem of failing public schools. Basically,
it’s everything you’ve heard about schools in the last two decades —
charter schools, No Child Left Behind, and accountability, the
achievement gap, Race to the Top, these were data-driven initiatives.
They assessed the educational landscape and identified schools that were
failing — teachers who were not getting results — children who were not
performing. At I.S. 293, this meant a flurry of new programs that came
and went, sometimes in rapid succession. First, I.S. 293 a grant from
RJR Nabisco to break itself up into small academies — smaller schools
within the building that would focus on different specialties. A
long-time 293 teacher, Carmen Sanchez, told me, after that, everything
just started changing. The staff turnover was dizzying.

  - carmen sanchez  
    All of a sudden, these people appear, and they are going to be the
    directors, not principals, directors of this math academy and
    academy in music.

chana joffe-walt

Ms. Sanchez says one of them came in to run the place, and she opened
her staff meeting by promising to fire everyone.

  - carmen sanchez  
    She lasted maybe nine months. She was gone. People just went — I
    mean, it was amazing. That was just as revolving door of principals
    or directors, and they just left.

  - dolores hadden smith  
    They keep changing over what kind of school you’re in — a science
    program school. Or you’re in a this. What are we, you know?

chana joffe-walt

Ms. Smith, Delores Hadden Smith, was in her third decade working at the
school when this started changing names. They were The Mathematics
Academy, The Academy for Performing and Fine Arts, The School for
Integrated Learning Through the Arts. Teachers left. New staff came in,
new initiatives. They needed to be smaller, more specialized. They
needed more science. They needed a trade. They needed to be a 6 through
12 school, middle and high school. Ms. Smith says this was confusing for
the parents, especially the parents in her community, the Gowanus
community, parents who went to 293 and knew it as 293. Now, they were
asking Ms. Smith, what happened to 293? The School for Integrated
Learning Through the Arts, what’s that mean?

  - dolores hadden smith  
    Well, I’m not sending my child there. I don’t want my child to go to
    a performing arts school. I want my child to go get academics. But
    we gave both. But they made it like it was a tap dance school. And
    they said, I don’t want my kids to go to a tap dance school. I want
    my kids go where they can get an education. Well, they thought we
    wasn’t teaching education because we are performing arts in our
    schools also? That was just a feature, one of the many features that
    we did. But the parents didn’t get it.

chana joffe-walt

By this time, public school admissions allowed more choice about where
parents sent their kids. So some of these local parents started choosing
other schools. 293 was losing students, which meant they were losing
money. A new principal came in — and an assistant principal named Jeff
Chetirko. By that point, 293 had been renamed The School for
International Studies. But not even assistant principal Chetirko knew
why. Prospective parents would ask him, why should I send my kids here?
What does international mean?

  - jeff chetirko  
    So I remember just having this horrible response — would be like,
    oh, yeah, our students come from all over the world, and that’s
    really what it’s about. It’s about our diversity, which is kind of
    bull. But that’s what I would sell because it didn’t sound like we
    really spoke a lot about it in the curriculum. And eventually —

  - chana joffe-walt  
    You did you have students from all over the world, right?

  - jeff chetirko  
    That’s true.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    I mean, you had students from maybe the Caribbean, from Yemen.

  - jeff chetirko  
    Yeah, towards the end, I think we had more from Caribbean. Or if we
    had that one student, we would be like, yeah, they’re from all over
    the world. \[LAUGHS\] You just make stuff up because you’re just
    trying to sell it.

chana joffe-walt

By 2003, SIS had low enrollment and terrible test scores. The state put
it on a failing schools list, the dreaded SURR list, Schools Under
Registration Review. Being on a failing schools list made it harder to
sell the school to prospective families, but it did mean SIS got a chunk
of money to turn things around. They bought new reading programs, an
academic intervention program. They doubled periods for reading and
math. During this time, the leadership was stable — less teacher
turnover. The school was less chaotic. The test scores stabilized. Jeff
Chetirko says they were feeling good about where things were headed.
Still, they had to compete for students. So he hired a marketing firm to
help draw families in.

  - jeff chetirko  
    I remember meeting the guy a couple of times. He had some good
    ideas. I don’t really remember what came out of it. It didn’t. We
    hung up signs outside the door, just tried to have a different look.
    But those banners, I think that came out of it.

chana joffe-walt

He says the marketing idea didn’t attract any local families into the
school. Instead, it attracted the attention of the New York Post, which
found out the school was trying to market itself, as it had been told
to, and wrote a snarky article about it. The headline read, “Lousy
Brooklyn Public School Wants to Hire a Press Agent to Enhance Appeal.”
it goes on to say, quote, “If they build a buzz, the kids will come.
That’s the thinking at a mediocre Brooklyn Public school with grandiose
aspirations.” The article ends with the list of suggested marketing
slogans for the school. It’s mean spirited and racist. Having trouble
with English? So is we. The School for International Studies, the best
six years of your life. Jaguar pride — where you can go from state
champs to state pen. The Jaguars — we score baskets; we just can’t count
them. Jeff says everyone at the school read it. He distinctly remembers
the feeling.

  - jeff chetirko  
    It’s horrible because if you’re publicly going to put us on a SURR
    list, what do you think you’re doing to that school? So now if we
    have to hire somebody to kind of get us off of that, that perception
    of this school’s a failing school, and then to get this newspaper
    article, it just deflates everything. It just really sucks.
    \[LAUGHS\] There’s no other way to say it. You get that pit feeling
    in your stomach. And you’re just like, ugh, what’s going on? Or
    what’s going to happen next? I think everybody is always nervous
    about what happens next. And then afterwards, you just get super
    furious.

chana joffe-walt

Here is what happened next.

  - archived recording  
    Hi. Hi, How are you? I’m OK. You waited patiently. Oh, my god. Yes.

chana joffe-walt

Six years later, I’m standing in a sweaty school gym at a middle school
fair for parents. It’s 2017, two years after that gala thrown by the
French Embassy for SIS. A couple dozen schools are here with information
tables. The table for the school for International Studies is mobbed.
There’s a line of parents waiting to get a chance to talk with someone
from the school. A mother named Anissa is near the very back of the
school.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    What have you heard about the International School?

  - anissa  
    I heard it’s a hot ticket. Everybody wants to get in there.

chana joffe-walt

After 40 years of being neglected, messed with by the school board,
after losing students and losing money, losing the building, being
blamed and publicly mocked, SIS was suddenly the hot ticket, as if
history had been wiped away. Parents asked the SIS admissions director,
can their kids get priority if they have good grades? Extracurriculars?
Does attendance count? They want to know if it helps their chances if
they show up for a tour.

  - archived recording  
    Yes. I open access to tours tomorrow at three o’clock.

chana joffe-walt

They want to know, will you have enough space for all these people?

  - archived recording  
    Oh, I don’t think I’ve got enough space. For next year, we’re only
    accepting 140 sixth graders.

chana joffe-walt

Three years earlier, SIS had 30 sixth graders. What changed? The
admissions director is the same. Most of the staff is the same. The
building is the same. The test scores are still pretty low. There’s an
IB program now in French. But the biggest change between the era of
being ignored and punished and the era of being celebrated and
oversubscribed is that white kids arrived. That’s what’s different, nine
times as many white students.

\[music\]

I.S. 293 was a mostly segregated school for decades. And still, it was
subject to the whims of white parents. Nice white parents shape public
schools even in our absence because public schools are maniacally loyal
to white families even when that loyalty is rarely returned back to the
public schools. Just the very idea of us, the threat of our displeasure,
warps the whole system. So separate is still not equal because the power
sits with white parents no matter where we are in the system. I think
the only way you equalize schools is by recognizing this fact and trying
wherever possible to suppress the power of white parents. Since no one’s
forcing us to give up power. We white parents are going to have to do it
voluntarily. Which, yeah, how’s that going to happen? That’s next time
on “Nice White Parents.”

    “Nice White Parents” is brought to you by Serial Productions, a New
    York Times Company.

chana joffe-walt

I want to tell you about another old film I found during my research.
It’s from 1951. We see a housewife, a white woman — everyone in this
film is white. She’s sitting in her living room with some neighbors.
They’re here to solve a problem. \[OLD MOVIE PLAYING\]

  - archived recording  
    A chain broke on a swing in a public playground, relatively
    unimportant, but a child might have been hurt.

chana joffe-walt

They sit on couches with notepads, deep in discussion. They will solve
this problem together. In another scene, a machinist in California
approaches his bus, the factory owner, with a request from the workers.

  - archived recording  
    I’d like to show you the new pension plan that we built. I thought
    we had discussed the pension plan previously.

chana joffe-walt

They had. The discussion requires listening, debating and waving your
arms a lot, which they do in the film.

  - archived recording  
    Not yet friends, they may never like each other. But they’ll sweat
    it out together. The problem is mutual. Much is involved. Developed
    within each citizen is the Democratic spirit, the Democratic method.

chana joffe-walt

Where were they taught the Democratic method, you might ask? Public
school, where the housewives taught to problem solve for the safety of
the community’s children, public school. This film was made by the
National Education Association. It’s a 25-minute promotional film that
spends almost no time inside schools. Instead, it’s all about the
purpose of public schools, how they prepare us to live together as
citizens. We see Americans use their public school training in everyday
life, when they sit with their neighbors, debate their bosses, when they
go shopping, and drive a car, buy a house. We are all part of a grand
play, interdependent — the senator, the homemaker, the factory worker.

  - archived recording  
    And Fred Gorman, the farmer of Pennsylvania, are his decisions
    important? They are, if the nation wants to eat.

chana joffe-walt

Fred the farmer has a nameless wife, whom we see now standing next to
him. Fred’s wife is trying to resolve a problem. The neighbors want to
build a drainage system into a pond. The lowest land for the pond is an
orchard that belongs to Fred and his nameless wife. The wife understands
that to prevent further flooding, she and Fred will need to sacrifice
for the greater good. Fred is not so sure.

  - archived recording  
    If we don’t do something to help, our land is going to get like
    theirs, and you know it. I don’t like the idea of losing those
    trees. There’s the problem in a nutshell, a tough one to crack, his
    land and his neighbors needs. A dictator could solve it for Fred,
    but he prefers to do his own thinking.

chana joffe-walt

Luckily, Fred has the tools to do it.

  - archived recording  
    Those tools are sharpened in the schools of America.

chana joffe-walt

And thank goodness, because the stakes are high.

  - archived recording  
    Problems every day, and the way they are solved determines the way
    the country functions.

chana joffe-walt

This vision of public schools, the same one laid out 100 years earlier
by the founder of American public schools Horace Mann is that America
and democracy cannot survive without public education. We need common
schools where rich and poor come together to solve problems, generate
fellow feeling. Public schools, the great equalizer. But I have made my
way through the history of one modern American public school. And from
what I can see, white parents are standing in the way of achieving this
vision. Our schools are not an equalizing force, because white parents
take them over and hoard resources. We’re not learning how to live
together as one society because white parents flee or cordon themselves
off in special gifted programs. Even when we’re not in the school
building, funding and attention still slide our way. So I don’t see how
it’s possible to have equal public schools, common schools that serve
every child, unless we limit the power of white parents. But how do we
do that? In all my reporting around this one school building from 2015
all the way back to the beginning, I’ve never seen that happen. And then
I did. From Serial Productions, I’m Chana Joffe-Walt. This is “Nice
White Parents,” a series about the most powerful force in public
schools: White people.

Recently, I’ve come across two examples of schools that seem to be
suppressing the power of white parents, two examples I found in the very
last place I expected, in the I.S. 293 building, one upstairs and one
downstairs. So today’s episode, what does it look like to limit the
power of white parents in schools? And does it work? Does it lead to an
equal education for everyone?

I’m going to start downstairs. Eight years ago, the city put a charter
school in the basement if I.S. 293. It’s called Success Academy. That
year I spent following the new white parents upstairs at the School For
International Studies, I would occasionally see Success Academy kids
around the building in orange and blue uniforms. It was always a little
startling because Success Academy is an elementary school. So they look
tiny in a building full of middle and high schoolers. But mostly, the
Success kids stood out because of the way they moved through the halls.

  - speaker  
    They walk in single forms like they’re in the Army. It’s so weird.
    If they don’t walk in single form, they stop the whole line.

chana joffe-walt

Denagee is one of the many students from SIS upstairs, who is eager to
tell me about the charter school and its rituals, their silent,
controlled lines.

  - denagee  
    It’s like a sense of the Children of the Corn. It creeps me out.

  - chris  
    Or Storm Troopers or something.

chana joffe-walt

That’s his friend Chris saying Storm Troopers. Sometimes they’ll hear
Success teachers say, make a bubble in your mouth. And then a line of
six-year-olds will close their lips and fill their cheeks up with air,
that way nobody’s talking. Chris and Denagee told me they look like
puffer fish.

  - denagee  
    I remember kindergarten very vividly. And I know if I was to have my
    face in a puffer fish, I would automatically just start making all
    types of sounds and stuff, you know?

chana joffe-walt

And they don’t?

  - denagee  
    No. That’s what’s so weird.
    
    It helps me think, or it makes me think about — what really happens
    inside of the classrooms with them to be coming out like that?

chana joffe-walt

The year I was reporting at SIS, The New York Times published a video
that showed a particular and alarming moment inside one of the Success
classrooms. It was secretly recorded by an assistant teacher, who leaked
it, and it went viral. You see a group of first-graders gathered in a
circle on a polka-dot rug, sitting legs crossed, hands in their laps.
And a teacher is asking one girl to correct a math problem she got
wrong.

  - speaker  
    You cut or you split. So count it again, making sure you’re counting
    correctly.

chana joffe-walt

The girl does not respond. The teacher leans in and repeats.

  - speaker  
    Count.

chana joffe-walt

The girl whimpers, or says something so quiet you can’t hear. The entire
class is watching. It’s silent, intense. The teacher is visibly upset,
picks up the child’s paper, and rips it in half, points an angry finger
to the side of the room.

  - speaker  
    Go to the calm down chair and sit.

chana joffe-walt

She goes. The teacher turns to the rest of the circle.

  - speaker  
    There’s nothing that infuriates me more than when you don’t do
    what’s on your paper. Somebody come up and show me how she should
    have counted to get her answer that was 1 and a split.

chana joffe-walt

A boy rushes over to do it correctly. But the teacher is not done
publicly reprimanding the girl, who’s now sitting to the side of the
classroom in the calm down chair.

  - speaker  
    Thank you. Do not go back to your seat and show me one thing and
    then don’t do it here. You’re confusing everybody. Very upset and
    very disappointed.

chana joffe-walt

The teacher is white. The girl whose work she just ripped up is not. The
whole thing is hard to watch. When this video came out, the student was
living at a homeless shelter with her mom. Success suspended this
teacher, but didn’t fire her. Instead, at a press conference, the C.E.O
reprimanded The New York Times for not understanding that this teacher
was having a bad day. When I asked about this incident, the C.E.O of
Success told me the teacher’s behavior was unacceptable. Teachers are
not allowed to yell at kids. But it was not a fireable offense. She says
the teacher made a mistake.

I have always been skeptical of Success Academy. Success has a
reputation for being harsh and punitive. Especially unnerving, to me at
least, is that they’re harsh, punitive approach is deployed in schools
across the city that are almost entirely BBlack and brown. Success
students are generally kids of color from working class or poor
families. The intense focus on policing kids’ bodies, on test prep
drills, frequent use of suspensions — you don’t see that in majority
white schools. I’ve never seen a line of uniformed, white students
walking through the halls of a public school building with their mouths
in bubbles, or being told to quote show urgency when they dawdle
unpacking their book bags or eating lunch, except for here. This
particular Success Academy in the basement of I.S. 293 is integrated. A
quarter of the student body is white. And it’s the first school I saw
putting limits on the power of white parents.

Success Academy is the city’s largest charter school network, 47
schools, elementary, middle, and one high school. They get public
funding, like all charter schools. Success Academy also gets private
funding. The state oversees charters, like Success. But it isn’t run by
the state or the city. It’s run by a private organization. And Success
is a choice school. That means families opt in to Success. The C.E.O, a
woman named Eva Moskowitz, opened her first 40 something schools in
largely working class Black and brown neighborhoods where she imagined
families would want a new school option. Then about a decade ago,
Moskowitz decided she wanted to open an integrated school, a new Success
Academy that was racially integrated and economically diverse. She
needed a school building where integration was possible, where perhaps,
half a century earlier, a group of white families pushed for a
strategically located fringe school building between two racially
segregated neighborhoods. And this is how Success Academy wound up here,
in the old I.S. 293 building because of yet another plan to integrate.
Only this time, it worked. White parents opted in. The way families at
this Success Academy — it’s called Success Academy Cobble Hill — tend to
come from advantage, just like the white parents upstairs at SIS.
They’re upper middle class and rich, doctors and lawyers, corporate
accountants, people who walk into most public schools with a lot of
power. But the influence I’d seen white parents wield upstairs at SIS,
that didn’t seem to be the case downstairs. I found that confusing. Do
you have a PTA? We have a parent council so it’s very similar to a PTA
this is Alissa Bishop, the principal of Success, Cobble Hill. The parent
council is not that similar to a PTA though, because in the very next
sentence, Principal Bishop told me that the parent council is not
allowed to raise money. This, I assumed, was probably difficult for
parents who are accustomed to fundraising for their kids’ schools. Have
you had parents who want to raise money, who come to you and are like, I
want to — I want this thing to happen, and I want to raise the money for
it.

  - alissa bishop  
    Not anything like that. I have had parents come to me and say I want
    to do a coat drive. They want to donate. We do that stuff throughout
    the entire year. But I’ve never had anyone approach me about
    donating money.

  - speaker  
    Oh, wow.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Really? No parents have been like I want to do a fundraiser for x,
    and you have to be like, that’s not a thing that we do?

  - alissa bishop  
    No. I’ve never had that. Principal Bishop looks over at the PR
    person, who’s come from Success headquarters to supervise this
    interview. The PR person shakes her head. No, parents don’t raise
    money.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    And what if somebody did want to raise money for the school — a
    parent wanted to raise money?

  - alissa bishop  
    Yeah, we don’t.

  - speaker  
    It’s against the policy.

  - alissa bishop  
    We don’t raise money.

chana joffe-walt

Principal Bishop looks over to the PR person again, as if to say, am I
not being clear with this chick? Why isn’t she getting it? But I seem to
be unable to stop myself from listing all the things I’ve seen white
advantaged parents demand in public schools.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    If parents were like, we want this to be a dual language French
    school, and we can help fund it —

  - alissa bishop  
    We don’t have — our curriculum is network-based. We’re given
    curriculum. We don’t have a language curriculum in our elementary
    schools.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Or, if parents were like, we want there to be less math, or a
    different kind of math, or we want there to be a film program, a
    film program, or whatever, any of those things. Parents are like, we
    want —

  - alissa bishop  
    Yeah, this is our model. It’s our model across all of our schools.
    No changes.

chana joffe-walt

The C.E.O. of Success Academy, Eva Moskowitz, followed up later to tell
me, if parents want to give money, they can. But it will be distributed
evenly across all of our schools. We can’t have our Cobble Hill families
getting more than our families in Harlem.

Here’s what I started to understand about how Success Academy was
limiting the power of white parents. Success was limiting the power of
white parents by limiting the power of all parents. I met a dad named
Travius Sharpe outside the building one day, a Black guy who grew up in
Brooklyn. His son Ethan is at Success.

  - travius sharpe  
    We actually get graded.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    You get graded?

  - travius sharpe  
    We get graded as the parents. We get an email saying, this is what
    your progress is saying.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    You get a grade, like an A, B, C?

  - travius sharpe  
    They get like a meeting expectations or —

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Not.

  - travius sharpe  
    — not.

chana joffe-walt

Upstairs, SIS tripped over itself to meet the demands of new, white
parents. Downstairs, all parents at Success Academy are being graded.
Even day to day, the Success principal and teachers make sure to remind
parents when they’re falling down on the job.

  - speaker  
    So we running a little late. Why is Ethan late? It’s your fault why
    he’s late. I think one day, I was late. And she texted and said,
    Ethan is not here yet. Any reason why? And I felt like I wasn’t the
    parent at that point. That’s their time. But it keeps you on your
    toes and stuff like that.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    You felt like you weren’t the parent.

  - speaker  
    I wasn’t the parent. I wasn’t the parent. And I felt like I was just
    dropping this kid off to his parents.

chana joffe-walt

One day, in the cafeteria, I met a white mom named Sarah Stanich. Sarah
is a financial advisor. Her son’s in fourth grade. And she was telling
me she likes the school, even though — and then Sarah lowered her voice,
pointed at her boy, and said, he’s been suspended.

  - sarah stanich  
    He’s been suspended. And I was not happy about that. And I
    definitely never had that experience when I was a kid. But —

  - chana joffe-walt  
    How old was he when that happened?

  - sarah stanich  
    Well, it’s happened more than once, embarrassingly.
    
    So kind of young. Maybe third grade, or maybe even second the first
    time it happened.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    How many times has he been suspended?

  - sarah stanich  
    A few times, a few times, probably three — but pushing, fighting.
    And he’s really not a fighter, but they’re boys, and — and sometimes
    I think it’s kind of harsh. They’re young kids. And I know that
    that’s a complaint about suspensions in the schools. But on the
    other hand, he had warnings, and it wasn’t that I think that his
    teachers had given him given him space and slack in other areas. I
    have no lingering anger about it.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Overall.

  - sarah stanich  
    Yeah. Overall, I’ve been I feel very lucky to have been able to be a
    part of this community and be part of this school. Sarah later wrote
    me to say her kid was actually suspended four times that year. I’ve
    reported on discipline in schools and the use of suspensions a lot.
    I’ve talked to many mothers of children who have been suspended. Not
    one of them has been white. Black kids are suspended in New York
    City schools at five times the rate of white kids. After I met
    Sarah, I double checked the numbers for the 2017 school year, just
    to be sure. In the regular New York City public schools that same
    year, not Success or other charters, but the traditional, public
    elementary schools, that year, there were 327 suspensions for
    non-white kids. For white kids, there were only nine. I was so
    surprised after meeting Sarah when I left the building I called two
    people, who know a lot about education to say this is what’s
    happening at Success Academy, Cobble Hill. White boys are being
    suspended, rich, white boys. And they couldn’t believe it either.
    One of them, Noliwe Rooks, a professor at Cornell, said, well, well,
    how’s that for equality?
    
    So white parents can’t raise money, they can’t ask for special
    programs, and their kids get suspended. Why are they suddenly OK
    with equality? I interviewed lots of Success parents.

  - suzanne gigliotti  
    We did get a flyer. They put them on the doors. They put them on the
    doors in the neighborhood.

chana joffe-walt

Suzanne Gigliotti saw the flyer for Success when her son was in
preschool. So she looked into it and every other possible school option
she had.

  - suzanne gigliotti  
    It was in our neighborhood. But more importantly, we toured so many
    schools, public, private, parochial. We were slated for 58, which is
    an excellent school. And we did get in there. But Success was head
    and above any school I’d seen, just the level of excellence. And
    yeah, nothing matched it. The test scores — almost every parent I
    spoke with said they were initially drawn to Success Academy because
    of the excellent test scores. If your measure of success in school
    is standardized tests — and at Success Academy, it is — this is one
    of the best schools in the city. The scores are truly remarkable.
    Success Academy students perform twice as well on state tests as
    regular New York City public school kids. The vast majority of
    Success kids pass the tests, 95%, 97%. In your average city public
    schools, it’s less than half. And even more impressive, to me at
    least, is that the kids at Success are doing well on tests no matter
    if they’re poor, or rich, or Black, or Latino, or Asian, or white.
    This is the problem that decades of public education reforms have
    tried to address, the achievement gap. Success Academy was pulling
    off, not only an integrated school, but an equal integrated school
    that was closing the achievement gap.
    
    The way Success achieves equality though, some things give me pause.

  - speaker  
    What’s my first expectation? Lock your hands. Track Kamira. The
    first expectation is read —

chana joffe-walt

Last year, I went into the Success classrooms.

  - speaker  
    Send Kamira some love. Give Kamira two claps. \[CLAPPING\] My
    expectation is that —

chana joffe-walt

I didn’t see any teachers reprimanding kids or ripping up work, like the
one in the video. What I did see were teachers, who issued a constant
wall of verbal directions, where to look, what to do, how to sit,
delivered in the same and consistent, neutral tone. When a teacher calls
on someone, she gives a direction to the class to track the speaker,
look at the person speaking. Meanwhile, a second teacher roams and
hovers, issuing reminders.

  - speaker  
    Lock your hands. Track Shana. Liam’s hands are locked tracking
    Shana. Lydia’s hands are locked tracking Shana. Colin’s hands are —

chana joffe-walt

Shana answers correctly.

  - speaker  
    Nice job, Shana. Nice job, Shana. Scanning for another friend on the
    carpet, who looks so professional, lock your hands, track Zoe.

chana joffe-walt

Success achieves equality, at least in part, through utter uniformity.
Every Success Academy across the city uses identical methods, identical
curricula, and identical classrooms. The kids sit on the same polka-dot
carpet, hands locked in their lap, same signs on the wall, singing the
same chants. Even the teachers look the same. They’re almost all young
white women in cotton dresses and ballet flats just out of college,
sometimes the same college. I know this because the classrooms are named
after teachers alma maters. And there are three Penn State classrooms.

  - speaker  
    How does it go? We are Penn State. Yeah, we pull our weight Yeah, we
    cannot wait. Yeah, to graduate. Roll call. It’s uh-huh. And then
    Shabooya, sha-sha-shabooya, role call. Shabooya, sha-sha-shabooya.

chana joffe-walt

Education people talk a lot about the difference between equality and
equity to a point that I believe is tiresome. But I thought about this
difference a lot at Success. Equality means everyone gets the same
thing. Equity means everyone gets what they need. Success is equal.
Everyone is treated the same. But kids are never all the same. Some kids
are chatty in the hallway, or need a minute to think before answering a
question. Some kids have a million bucks at home, and some kids don’t. A
Black girl might respond differently than a white girl to being
reprimanded by a white teacher. A single parent with two jobs might have
a harder time getting their kid to school on time than, say, a
stay-at-home mom with a partner. One of the main criticisms of Success
Academy from public education advocates is that Success doesn’t actually
serve all students, that it has excellent test scores because it serves
a select group of students. Kids who don’t test well, or can’t sit
still, they’re weeded out of the school. Success Academy vehemently
denies this. They point out that they make special accommodations for
kids with special needs, and they note that they don’t get to choose
students because kids get spots in their schools by random lottery. And
that’s true. But it’s also true that lots of parents don’t apply to the
lottery because they know the school’s culture and the demands it makes
of families won’t work for them. And plenty of kids who do end up at
Success don’t last long. Maybe they get held back a grade or they’re
suspended. A civil rights complaint filed on behalf of more than a dozen
families alleges their children were regularly removed from class and
suspended, seven, 10, 13 times at Success Academy. Most of those
families eventually left the school.

I had a thought walking through Success. I suspected that the strict
classroom control was partly what made white parents feel comfortable at
Success Academy. I’m speculating here. None of the white parents I spoke
with told me they chose Success because the school polices Black and
brown students so well. And I don’t believe this is a conscious thought
for anyone. But I do know that white parents bring plenty of unconscious
biases to public schools with Black and brown kids, fears that the
classrooms will be chaotic, or not challenging, that the kids will be
disorderly or threatening. White parents worry that our kids will be
harmed. Success Academy completely controls for these fears. Everyone
gets excellent test scores. There’s no room for misbehavior, no risk of
disruption because there are no idle moments. If 30 children need to
move from their desks to the rug, it sounds like this.

  - speaker  
    On your bottom, on the black line in five, four, three, two, one.

chana joffe-walt

Every kid is on their bottom, hands locked, eyes tracking the teacher,
except for one boy. He gets a correction.

Success operates on the principle that with rigor and discipline
uniformly applied, all students will achieve equally well. It’s a
tempting vision, especially coming from upstairs, where the power of
white parents seem to have no bounds. But equality does not necessarily
shift the balance of power. White parents aren’t running the show here,
but Success is run by a white C.E.O and a board that includes
millionaire hedge fund managers — sorry, billionaire hedge fund
managers. The board of trustees is listed on the success website. And
the bios include Maverick Capital, Redwood Capital, Glenview Capital,
Cumulus Media, Morgan Stanley, Facebook, Arnold & Porter. This is not
exactly a disruption to the social order, is all I’m saying. You can
limit the day-to-day influence of white parents. But still, rich white
people control the agenda, the priorities, and the money.

Back in 2015, the year of the white influx and SIS, toward the end of
that school year, I was talking to Imee Hernandez one day. She was the
PTA co-president of SIS. And Imee told me watching all those white
parents come and take over, it was almost like watching tumbleweed move
along in the wind. It was so quiet. That’s how they moved through here,
she said, picking up power as they went.

  - imee hernandez  
    Like a tumbleweed, it starts really soft and slow, and it keeps just
    picking up speed and getting bigger. So it’s really soft and slow.
    But it’s getting bigger. It’s not like an avalanche that comes at
    you. It’s just tumbling along very slowly. So it’s very light. You
    don’t feel it coming at you.

chana joffe-walt

Back then, Imee told me there’s no stopping it. She’s worried she
couldn’t protect what she loved about her school.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    If you were right, and the worst case scenario happens, what does
    that look like in a year or two?

  - imee hernandez  
    That there’s no more color in this school.
    
    Then there’s no more community, which I really hope I’m wrong.
    That’s my biggest fear. Then I would question if my daughter’s
    coming back. I really would.

chana joffe-walt

Imee feared that each year, more and more white families come into SIS
until it just became like the other segregated middle schools, where all
the white parents fought to enroll their kids. Against the repetition of
history, Imee was wrong. What happened at SIS was nothing like she or I
expected. That’s up next when we go back upstairs.

This past spring, a Black teacher at Success Academy named Fabiola St
Hillaire publicly criticized the C.E.O. for not taking a stand after the
murder of George Floyd, or acknowledging the effect police violence was
having on the families and communities Success serves. After that, more
staff, families, and alumni raised alarms about Success, calling some of
its practices racist and abusive, its discipline policies, the way white
staff and leadership speak to kids and parents of color. In response,
the C.E.O. apologized, and Success has released a plan that commits to
mandatory bias and sensitivity training for staff. The plan says they
will create an Equity Team and review their culture, their relationships
with staff, and families, and kids with quote, “an attention and
sensitivity to race.” I read this plan and thought, huh, there is a
school that’s already doing many of these things, right in the same
building, right upstairs.

  - speaker  
    OK, welcome. Hello. Thank you.

chana joffe-walt

It’s September, 2019. I’m back at SIS. It’s been four years since the
French gala and the drama with the PTA. Rob, the dad, who fundraises,
he’s not here anymore. His son finished middle school. Imee is still
here. Her daughter is a junior in high school. And a new crop of sixth
graders and their families are settling into the auditorium.

  - speaker  
    Welcome to PA Chaz. Welcome. Please, find a seat for me. Thank you.

chana joffe-walt

The school is no longer called SIS, the School for International
Studies. It’s now BHS, the Boerum Hill School for International Studies.
They changed the name, again. BHS has a new principal, Nicole
Lanzillatto. She gets up on stage, and the staff cheers. Miss
Lanzillatto welcomes the new families to BHS.

  - nicole lanzillatto  
    Any school is a microcosm of the world, and we are blessed with
    beautiful diversity.

chana joffe-walt

Miss Lanzillatto lists the ways the school reflects the world, race,
ethnicity, language, gender.

  - nicole lanzillatto  
    We are an extraordinarily diverse community. And it’s a beautiful
    thing, and we fight for it, and we work on it.

chana joffe-walt

Miss Lanzillatto says BHS is going for true equity. She says the word
equity three times in this welcome speech. Miss Lanzillatto is white,
chatty, well-liked, with black hair that’s styled straight up. The hair
is really Miss Lanzillatto’s defining feature. Picture boy band
pompadour. She’s worked here most of her professional career. The year
white families arrived at SIS, Miss Lanzillatto was the assistant
principal. She won’t say anything bad about that year. It was a learning
experience. It’s a process her predecessor, Ms. Juman, talks about it
the same way. Remember? Principals — diplomatic. They’re careful not to
place blame, but both of them said after that year, it was clear they
needed to intervene. One of the first things Miss Lanzillatto did as
principal was request special permission to reserve 40% of the seats for
kids who get free and reduced price lunch. The majority of kids who get
free and reduced price lunch are kids of color. And Miss Lanzillatto
didn’t want the school to flip. She didn’t want Black and brown kids to
get pushed out. The assistant principal told me they wanted to make sure
the school did not become colonized. Some things here have changed. They
got rid of the foundation, the Brooklyn World Project Rob and the other
white parents had created. They scrapped some of the French programming,
hired more teachers and staff of color. And one of the most striking
changes I noticed — spend 10 minutes of the school, and you can’t not
notice — Miss Lanzillatto is talking directly and constantly about race
and equity. She told me everyone here needs to be on alert for racist
habits and ideas. They need to aggressively address them, whenever they
pop up, in the cafeteria, in the classroom.

  - nicole lanzillatto  
    There’s a conversation happening in the school around the smart
    classes and the non-smart classes. Let’s talk about it where is that
    coming from. So I think it’s really about being a beast. I think
    it’s about everything we do coming back to it.

chana joffe-walt

Coming back to equity. I could not get over how much time and energy the
school puts into ensuring equity, not equality, equity. It’s almost like
the obsessive focus Success puts on making sure everything is the same
is exactly matched by the obsessive focus BHS just puts on recognizing
everyone is not the same. BHS formed an Equity Committee of staff and
students a few years ago. They looked for bias in the curriculum, in the
signs on their walls and the books on their shelves. They analyzed
achievement data, discipline data, where they could clearly see that the
school punished Black boys more harshly than other students. So they
revamped their entire approach to discipline, created a restorative
Justice Department. They applied for grants to help pay for this to
train their teachers on implicit bias and then train them again. They
brought in experts.

  - speaker  
    And here are some things that I look for in transition. So how do
    kids engage with each other? Is it verbal engagement? Is it
    non-verbal engagement?

chana joffe-walt

Last fall, I watched two equity consultants, Cornelius and Kass Minor,
show a group of BHS teachers how to observe racial dynamics in their
school. This involved teachers walking around in a huddle with
clipboards, taking diligent notes as kids walk through the hallways.

  - speaker  
    One fun lens to look at — and I’m just naming things out — I often
    ask, what are boys doing? What are girls doing? What are Black
    students doing? What are students of color doing?

chana joffe-walt

Mr. Minor is full of fun things the teachers should look for.

  - speaker  
    Here’s another fun thing to do, just because we’re out here. I do
    drive-bys in the hallway, where I walk by classroom windows, and I
    look in.

chana joffe-walt

They all take turns peering through the small window of a classroom
door. They take more notes. Later, the teachers meet as a group. And one
teacher, Stacy Ann Manswell, explains her observations from a math
class.

  - stacy ann manswell  
    And then in the math classroom that we were in, something that stood
    out to me — so there was two white males, white female, Black male.
    And I’m walking around. And Black male, he was finished. And he
    finished early, waiting for his peers to do the Think Right Pair
    Share. And when the timer went off, the girl, the white girl he was
    sitting next to, he looked to her, but she looked to the two white
    boys. And they formed the pair. So it was like, now she had to work
    with him. But she was sort of looking for the other two boys for
    validation for what this boy was saying. So my teacher self is like,
    OK, does this child not participate in class, and she doesn’t trust
    that he knows what he’s doing, or is it because she doesn’t see him
    because he’s a Black boy and she figures he’s not capable?

chana joffe-walt

The teachers talked about this moment in depth, what it might mean, what
messages the kids were picking up in their school about race, about
who’s important, who’s bad, who’s smart. And it’s not just the staff.
The administration is telling white parents that their mere presence in
the school does not make it integrated. They have to work at making this
place fair.

  - meghan casey  
    So this is our agenda today. We’re going to start with a reflection,
    and we’re going to get into how we talk about race with our young
    people.

chana joffe-walt

One Saturday morning, a group of two dozen parents gathered in the BHS
library for something called Family Academy. This event was open to
everyone, but mostly white parents showed up. And many of them shared
that they had never really talked about race very much when they were
growing up.

  - meghan casey  
    Show of hands, if race was not talked about, or only minimally
    talked about, or sort of avoided in some way. So just looking around
    the room, it’s about half — no, about 60% of us.

chana joffe-walt

Assistant Principal Meghan Casey walks went through a workshop on race
and racism in America and child development. I think about how just a
few years ago, the buzzword in this very school was diversity. Everyone
is all about celebrating diversity. But now, Meghan Casey tells this
room of parents diversity is not the goal. Having a diverse school does
not mean we have an integrated school. We need to work on that to get to
an integrated school. She says they surveyed BHS students last year,
asking them about their experiences.

  - meghan casey  
    And our white kids overall said it feels like I’m in a Benetton ad,
    and it’s so diverse, and lovely, and I’m not experiencing racism, or
    racial bias, or implicit bias here at school. It’s great. And our
    kids of color were saying, they feel less loved, less seen. They
    talked — though they didn’t use this language, they talked about
    stereotype threat, they talked about implicit bias. They talked
    about moments with white peers that were uncomfortable, where a
    friendship felt a little strained. And it was clear to them that
    their white friend just didn’t — did not have bad intentions, loved
    them, good friend, but didn’t know the harm that they were creating,
    and just didn’t have the same knowledge base that they had about
    race and about racial consciousness. I want to just make sure,
    because it’s for whatever reason — I don’t know why — sometimes we
    think that things are better than they are. I just wanted to come
    back to our students. They are reporting that this is urgent, and we
    need to continue to deal with it. And it’s not a Benetton ad, even
    if some of our kiddos think it is.

chana joffe-walt

It’s a little jarring to hear school leaders telling parents, even
though everything looks OK, it’s not. Principal Lanzillatto says she
knows it can be hard to hear some of this stuff.

  - nicole lanzilltto  
    And some people are going to feel pissed off about it, and some
    people do. And that means some people are going to leave the room
    feeling like they’re being blamed. But at the end of the day, this
    is about kids. This is about serving kids and including families and
    communities. What else is the point of the school, right? That’s the
    whole point of a school.

chana joffe-walt

Is that the point of a school? When Miss Lanzillatto said this, I got
stuck on the phrase. What is the point of a public school? We don’t seem
to have any kind of unified vision. Maybe there was one back when they
made that old film about public schools teaching us about democracy and
how to live together. But we don’t have a shared vision now. What we
have is choice. You can choose your vision for a public school. You can
go to the test score school, like Success Academy, or the racial justice
school, like BHS. There is no city policy that says every school needs
to be integrated and equitable. It’s up to us. If we want that, we can
choose it. For families with the most power, the most choices, that
means we get to choose. Do we want to play fair or not? At BHS, families
were choosing equity, white advantaged families. I didn’t see anyone
leave the room at that parents workshop, or seem upset, or blamed at
all. The parents I met at BHS of all races were pretty happy with the
school. They seemed bought in. Meanwhile, the test scores at be adjust
have improved dramatically. There’s still an achievement gap, but it
seems to be closing. Black boys are no longer being disciplined at much
higher rates than everyone else. And the kids seem happy, warm, and
confident, and adept at talking about things like race and power. One
day though, I heard a rumor. It was going around the high school. Kids
were saying the PTA was stealing money from the high school and giving
it to the middle school. I heard it first in the library from a group of
10th graders. They said the PTA had taken $1,500 to create a garden, and
they were pissed. Later, I heard it again from a tenth grader named
Farzana. And it wasn’t $1,500 anymore.

  - farzana  
    Yeah, so they just received $15,000 for gardening. What else can
    that $15,000 be used for so much more?

chana joffe-walt

This was meaningful because the BHS middle school is much whiter and
larger than the high school. And despite all the focus on racial equity
for the past few years, the PTA leadership at BHS is now almost all
white, a lot of middle school parents, which has not escaped the notice
of students, who have been encouraged by their school to notice such
things and call them out. A girl named Paola told me we have to keep
watching them because there’s no one there representing us. My mom
works. She can’t go to PTA meetings.

  - paola  
    It’s just very unfair, that the fact that your mom can be in the PTA
    and make all these rules, and be like, no. We want the money from
    middle school.

  - jeremiah  
    Yeah. They’re like this all power thing that’s above everybody’s
    head that can just take this money and do this. You know what I
    mean?

chana joffe-walt

That’s Jeremiah jumping in. Jeremiah is a kid who jumps in. He’s the guy
you go to if you’re feeling angry about something unjust, and what you
want more than anything is someone who will feel just as angry as you
do. Jeremiah tells Paola this is ridiculous. I’m going to go to the PTA
and just tell them straight up.

  - jeremiah  
    You guys need to stop taking, stop taking money from this to put in
    their middle school programs. You know what I mean? It’s just too
    much.

  - paola  
    Your middle school already has it enough. Why do you want more?

chana joffe-walt

I wasn’t sure they had the details exactly right. But I did think, yeah,
here we go again. The mostly white PTA probably is manipulating where
money goes. So I looked into it, and it wasn’t true. The PTA did not
steal money from the high school. It did get money for a garden, but it
was grant money, not regular PTA money. Plus, the garden is mostly for
the culinary program, which mostly serves the high school. Jeremiah
texted me a few days after we spoke to say, sorry to bother you, but I
think I might have been a little too critical of the school. Is it
possible to do a follow-up interview? He was mad at himself and his
friends for believing the rumor. He was mad that he said it to me and
looked stupid.

  - jeremiah  
    I think there was some leftover feelings. Honestly, I can’t even say
    because —

chana joffe-walt

What do you mean by leftover feelings?

  - jeremiah  
    Because that’s been the understanding for five years. You know what
    I mean? It’s always been that.

chana joffe-walt

It’s always been that. It took me a while to get Jeremiah to say more
about what he meant by that. Jeremiah is 15 years old. When he was in
third grade, the city closed his mostly Black school — called it
failing. His mom, a Black woman, fought the school closing as hard as
she could — went to every meeting. It happened anyway. The city put a
charter school in the building. And it also opened a new small school
designed to appeal to the newly gentrified neighborhood. It had a global
studies curriculum and a dual language Spanish program. Jeremiah went
there third through fifth grade. Then he went to SIS for middle school,
the year the white kids came in. Suddenly, his science class was
sometimes taught in French. The after school programs he wanted to go
to, also French, which he didn’t love, for obvious reasons.

  - jeremiah  
    Because I can’t speak French. So that was pretty annoying.

chana joffe-walt

Right, Jeremiah, a Black kid, believed a rumor that white parents in the
PTA were stealing from him and his classmates because he understands
that this is how schools work. He has leftover feelings. Jeremiah likes
the new BHS, and he says it does feel more integrated and more equal. I
told him about some of the white parents I had been meeting at the
school, who seemed truly committed to integration.

  - jeremiah  
    I think that for white moms just think — I think its popular now.
    It’s like yoga. It’s like, oh, yeah, integration. It’s cool now.
    It’s a new thing.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    And what do you make of that?

  - speaker  
    Yeah. You’re a part of it. Thanks, but are you just — do you
    genuinely care, or is it everyone’s doing it? When it’s not
    beneficial to the white families, it’s going to be changed. And
    history repeats itself. So when this integration isn’t beneficial,
    then it’ll go right back to where it was before.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    History repeats itself is a very central thesis of my story.

  - jeremiah  
    Yeah. It’s just truth for life.
    
    When integration is not helpful, it’s going to become segregated
    again.

chana joffe-walt

That’s probably true. White parents are opting in to be at BHS right
now. But they can just as easily opt out. Historically, they have.

When this school building first opened its doors years ago, Black and
Puerto Rican parents were demanding integrated equal schools city wide
for everybody. They weren’t asking for one curated school or a small
network of schools where people could integrate, if they wanted to. They
were asking the Board of Education to have a plan for all schools. They
were asking for things to go differently than they have for all of
history. Next time, on “Nice White Parents,” things go differently.

**On this series:**

Chana Joffe-Walt is a producer for the award-winning public radio show
“This American Life*,”* where Chana originated her reporting for what
eventually became “Nice White Parents.” In 2015, Chana teamed up with
the reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones to do several stories about
[education](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/550/three-miles) and
[school
segregation](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with-part-one),
for which they won the Peabody Award. In addition to education coverage,
Chana’s reporting on sexual harassment, including the Rashomon-style
“This American Life*”* episode ”[Five
Women](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/640/five-women),” offered a new
frame to understand a wave of \#MeToo stories. “Five Women” is currently
being adapted into a TV series. Before joining “This American Life,”
Chana was a reporter for NPR, where she helped create the podcast
“Planet Money.”
