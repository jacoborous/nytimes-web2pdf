Rollback}\label{epa-inspector-general-to-investigate-trumps-biggest-climate-rollback}}

The agency's watchdog office said Monday it would investigate whether
the reversal of Obama-era fuel efficiency standards violated government
rules.

WASHINGTON --- The Environmental Protection Agency's internal watchdog
said Monday it had opened an investigation into the agency's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/30/climate/trump-fuel-economy.html}{weakening
of Obama-era regulations} that would have limited automobile emissions
by significantly raising fuel economy standards.

The inspector general demanded that top E.P.A. officials turn over
briefing materials and other documents pertaining to the regulation,
which was finalized in late March as the Trump administration's single
largest rollback of federal climate change rules.

Auditors said they intended to investigate whether the Trump
administration acted ``consistent with requirements, including those
pertaining to transparency, record-keeping, and docketing, and followed
the E.P.A.'s process for developing final regulatory actions.''

The yearlong effort to write the Trump administration rule was plagued
with controversy. Just weeks before the final rule was published, the
administration's own internal analyses showed that it would
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/13/climate/trump-fuel-economy-rollback.html}{create
a higher cost for consumers} than leaving the Obama-era standard in
place and would contribute to more deaths associated with lung disease
by releasing more pollution into the air.

``This is really serious,'' said Vickie Patton, general counsel for the
Environmental Defense Fund. ``It's rare for E.P.A.'s inspector general
to conduct an investigation of the agency's rule-making.''

    The E.P.A. inspector general plans to investigate whether a rollback

    government rules}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Multiple outside economists and public health experts have questioned
the administration's justification of the rule,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/climate/trump-pollution-rollback.html}{saying
its calculations do not stand up to rigorous independent analysis} and
calling on the administration to make public the formulas and economic
models used to reach its conclusions.

James Hewitt, an E.P.A. spokesman, said in a statement that the agency
``will respond'' to the inspector general ``through the appropriate
channels'' and defended the new rule as ``a sensible, single national
program that strikes the right regulatory balance, protects our
environment, and sets reasonable targets for the auto industry.''

The audit cites documents obtained and provided to investigators by
Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Environment
and Public Works Committee.

Senator Carper said the documents showed that the Department of
Transportation wrote the bulk of the draft rule submitted to the White
House for review, and that E.P.A. career staff members had complained in
writing that they were shut out of the process. They also pointed to
numerous errors in the rule.

The E.P.A. then ``purposefully and potentially illegally withheld these
documents from being placed into the rule-making docket,'' Senator
Carper said in a
\href{https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/d/0/d097fdd0-0105-4a39-9604-f8a1ddd5aaa6/735111CEA8E5499130FD7DD880453FCF.05-18-20-tc-cars-letter-to-epa-ig-002-.pdf}{May
letter}, and later made changes to the final rule after it was signed
and before it was published in the federal register.

In a statement, Senator Carper said the documents his office had
obtained and turned over to the inspector general's office ``demonstrate
significant irregularities and illegalities'' in the rule-making
process.

He called the rollback ``the product of the most procedurally
problematic process my office has ever reviewed.''

The new rules require fuel economy standards to rise by about 1.5
percent a year, compared to the 5 percent annual increase required by
the Obama rule. That would allow cars to emit nearly a billion tons more
carbon dioxide over the lifetime of the vehicles covered by the rule
than they would have under the Obama standards. The Trump administration
said the new rules would cut the future price of new vehicles by around
\$1,000 and reduce traffic deaths, a finding environmental and consumer
groups dispute.

A former Trump administration official acknowledged that political
appointees working on the rule had rushed to complete it before April,
fearing that, if it was published later this year, it could be quickly
overturned in 2021, should former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. win
the White House.

Trump administration officials were acutely aware that a Biden
administration could use a law called the Congressional Review Act,
which says that any regulation finalized within 60 legislative days of
the end of a presidential term
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/climate/trump-regulations-election.html}{can
be overturned with a simple congressional vote} that is not subject to
filibuster or any other Senate rules to slow it down.

``It was openly discussed: If you don't get something done by the end of
April, it's exposed to being overturned by the C.R.A.,'' said Michael
McKenna, a former White House liaison to Congress. ``Everybody thought
of the SAFE rule as priority No. 1,'' he said, referring to the
administration's acronym for the rollback of the emissions standard.

``They rushed to get it done,'' he added.
