U.S.
Death}\label{coronavirus-death-in-california-came-weeks-before-first-known-us-death}}

The earliest U.S. deaths publicly attributed to the virus had been on
Feb. 26, when two people died in the Seattle area. Santa Clara County
said an autopsy showed a Feb. 6 death was also related.

SAN FRANCISCO --- Officials in Santa Clara County, Calif., announced
late Tuesday that two residents there died of
the\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/science/ultraviolet-light-coronavirus.html}{coronavirus}
in early and mid-February, making them the earliest known victims of the
pandemic in the United States.

The new information may shift the timeline of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/technology/coronavirus-treatment-benevolentai-baricitinib.html}{virus's}
spread through the country weeks earlier than previously believed.

The first report of a coronavirus-related death in the United States
came on Feb. 29 in the Seattle area, although officials there later
discovered that two people who had died Feb. 26 also had the virus.

But Santa Clara County officials said that autopsies of two people who
died at their homes on Feb. 6 and Feb. 17 showed that the individuals
were infected with the virus. The presence of the disease Covid-19 was
determined by tissue samples and was confirmed by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, county health officials said in a
statement.

``Each one of those deaths is probably the tip of an iceberg of unknown
size,'' Dr. Sara Cody, the county's chief medical officer, said in an
interview. ``It feels quite significant.''

Dr. Cody said the individuals who died in February did not have any
known travel histories that would have exposed them to the virus, which
first appeared in China. They are presumed to have contracted the virus
in the community, she said.

The newly reported deaths suggest that the coronavirus may have been
spreading in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/04/us/coronavirus-california-liberals.html}{California}
much earlier than was previously known, said Dr. Jeffrey V. Smith, the
Santa Clara county executive and a medical doctor.

``It was probably around unrecognized for quite some time,'' Dr. Smith
said.

It was unclear early Wednesday why it had taken so long to identify the
February deaths as caused by the coronavirus.

Much debate has centered on the question of when the virus arrived in
the United States and how early it began to spread among people.
Problems and delays slowed the availability of widespread testing for
the virus, which has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{killed
more than 40,000 people} nationwide.

In January, the authorities identified a series of coronavirus cases
from travelers abroad, but they did not identify any community spread of
the virus for several weeks.

The federal government had strict rules on who qualified for coronavirus
testing, and test kits developed by the C.D.C. --- that public health
labs began receiving on Feb. 7 ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/18/health/cdc-coronavirus-lab-contamination-testing.html}{turned
out to be faulty}. Strict definitions of who could be tested limited
what local health officials could do to find out how widespread the
virus might be.

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

    seems likely, for at least several months.} There have been
    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second
    bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a
    drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll
    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9}{produce}
    immune molecules called antibodies, which are

    These antibodies may} last in the body

    three months}, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal
    after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an
    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to

``We had to ask the C.D.C. every single time: Does this person meet the
case definition? May we send a sample?'' Dr. Cody said.

``We had this very, very uncomfortable feeling that we were hearing
about a lot of patients who really felt that they were cases but we
couldn't test,'' she said.

Other indications have emerged that the virus may have been spreading
earlier than previously known. The Grand Princess cruise ship that
departed San Francisco on Feb. 11 had passengers who developed the
coronavirus on board. Researchers believe that the virus also
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html}{began
to circulate in the New York area} by mid-February. And in early March,
researchers found a range of cases with genetic similarities to each
other in the Seattle area, suggesting that it had been spreading
undetected for weeks.

In Santa Clara County, Dr. Cody said that the picture of the spread was
becoming clearer but that there were still gaps.

``We had so few pixels you could hardly pick out the image,'' she said.
``Suddenly we have many pixels that all of sudden that we didn't even
realize that we were looking for.''

But, she added, ``I can't put the story together yet.''

On March 16, Santa Clara County was among the first counties in the
nation
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/us/california-covid-19.html}{to
announce stay-at-home orders}. ``Clearly in retrospect that was a good
decision,'' Dr. Cody said. ``Now we see there was even more transmission
than we recognized.''

Although California was an early state to report that individuals were
carrying the virus, it has had one-tenth the number of deaths as New
York State,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{the
hardest-hit place in America}. Officials believe that the early
imposition of stay-at-home orders and the state's lower population
density are among factors that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/us/california-coronavirus-shutdown.html}{have
helped California} avoid the worst so far.

Thomas Fuller reported from San Francisco and Mike Baker from Seattle.
