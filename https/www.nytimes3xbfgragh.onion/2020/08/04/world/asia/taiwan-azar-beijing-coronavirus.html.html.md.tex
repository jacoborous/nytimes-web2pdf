The trip by Alex M. Azar II, a rare high-level U.S. visit, is being
billed as an opportunity to highlight Taiwan's success in battling the

TAIPEI, Taiwan --- The United States' top health official, Alex M. Azar
II, will lead a delegation on a trip to Taiwan, a rare high-level visit
by an American official to the island that is likely to anger China and
further fray ties between Beijing and Washington.

The trip by Mr. Azar, the secretary of health and human services, will
be the first by a U.S. health secretary and the first in six years by a
U.S. cabinet member, the department said in a
\href{https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/08/04/hhs-secretary-alex-azar-lead-delegation-taiwan-in-first-visit-by-us-hhs-secretary.html}{statement}
on Tuesday.

No date was given for the visit to Taiwan, a self-ruled territory that
is claimed by Beijing, but the health department billed it as an
opportunity to strengthen economic and public health cooperation between
the United States and Taiwan and to highlight
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/09/world/asia/taiwan-vice-president-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=9}{Taiwan's
success in battling the coronavirus pandemic.}

``Taiwan has been a model of transparency and cooperation in global
health during the Covid-19 pandemic and long before it,'' Mr. Azar said
in the department's statement. ``I look forward to conveying President
Trump's support for Taiwan's global health leadership and underscoring
our shared belief that free and democratic societies are the best model
for protecting and promoting health.''

As of Tuesday, the island of 23 million people just off the coast of
southern China had reported 476 coronavirus cases and seven deaths.
Officials in Taiwan have tried to turn their relative success in
battling the coronavirus at home
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/world/asia/coronavirus-china-taiwan.html?searchResultPosition=4}{into
a geopolitical victory.} The island has sent millions of masks,
emblazoned with the words ``made in Taiwan,'' to the United States,
Italy and other countries devastated by the coronavirus.

It has also promoted itself as a model of democracy amid China's own
campaign to use the crisis to promote the strength of its authoritarian
system.

The announcement of Mr. Azar's visit comes as case numbers have been
surging throughout most of the United States, where more than 4.7
million people have been infected and at least 157,100 have died,
according to a New York Times database.

Chinese officials did not immediately respond to the announcement. But
Mr. Azar's visit will almost certainly enrage Beijing, which has long
sought to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and has objected to U.S. support
for the island, which remains an important, though unofficial, American
ally in the Pacific region. Though the United States has been cautious
in holding official contact with Taiwan, it continues to be the island's
leading arms supplier.

Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that Mr. Azar would meet
with senior Taiwanese leaders, including President Tsai Ing-wen.
Discussions are expected to touch on Taiwan's role as a supplier of
medical equipment and critical technology, among other issues, the U.S.
health department said. The island is home to one of the world's leading
computer chip makers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and is
a major manufacturer of medical masks and other hospital equipment.

The health secretary will also deliver a speech in which he will
highlight ``Taiwan's constructive role in the international community,
especially in global public health,'' the statement said.

The trip threatens to further fuel tensions between the United States
and China, with diplomatic ties reaching their lowest point since the
two countries normalized relations more than four decades ago. The two
superpowers have become increasingly locked in a fast-growing battle on
multiple fronts, including in trade, technology, defense and human
rights.

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

In addition, Beijing has in recent years
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/16/world/asia/solomon-islands-taiwan-china.html}{steadily
picked off} Taiwan's few remaining official allies and has blocked
Taiwan's participation as an observer in the World Health Assembly, the
World Health Organization's top decision-making body.

The tense relations between Beijing and Taiwan dates to 1949, when the
Communist Party defeated its Nationalist rivals, who fled to the island
and set up the Republic of China government that still rules the
territory today. Unification with Taiwan remains one of the Chinese
Communist Party's ultimate goals, and in recent years, China's top
leader, Xi Jinping, has bluntly warned that any move toward formal
independence by the island would invite military force.

Mr. Azar will be the highest-ranking American cabinet official to visit
the island since 1979, the year the U.S. switched its recognition of the
Chinese government from Taiwan to Beijing. The last trip by a U.S.
cabinet-level official to Taiwan was in 2014 by Gina McCarthy, then the
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Health and Human Services Department did not say whether Mr. Azar
would attend an official memorial that has been established in Taipei
for
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/world/asia/lee-teng-hui-dead.html?searchResultPosition=1}{Lee
Teng-hui,} the former Taiwanese president who died last week.

In a
\href{https://www.state.gov/on-the-passing-of-former-taiwan-president-lee-teng-hui/}{statement}
offering his condolences, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised Mr.
Lee, who led the island's transformation into a vibrant democracy,
crediting him with ending decades of authoritarianism and ushering in a
``new era of economic prosperity, openness and the rule of law.''
