Three crew members aboard were spared when the virus spread through the
boat. They were the only ones who had antibodies at the beginning of the
trip.

A fishing vessel that left Seattle in May returned with an unexpected
catch: the first direct evidence in humans that antibodies to the
coronavirus can thwart infection.

More than a hundred crew members aboard the American Dynasty were
stricken by the infection over 18 days at sea. But three sailors
\href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20173161v1}{who
initially carried antibodies remained virus-free,} according to a new
report.

Although the study is small, it addresses one of the most important
questions in the pandemic: whether the immune response to one bout with
the virus protects against reinfection.

``Knowing the answer to this question is critical for vaccine design and
epidemiology,''
\href{https://twitter.com/jbloom_lab/status/1294378351809855490}{tweeted
Jesse Bloom}, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center in Seattle and one of the study's authors.

The study was posted online last week and has not yet been published in
a peer-reviewed journal. Still, the finding set off optimistic chatter
among scientists, who have been relying on monkey studies for evidence
of antibodies' potency.

``I thought it was very exciting --- good enough news that I was telling
my family about it,'' said Michal Tal, an immunologist at Stanford
University who was not involved in the work.

Several research teams have reported that an encounter with the virus
triggers a robust immune response in most people, including in those who
may have been only mildly ill. And the vaccine candidates now in trials
also seem to elicit strong neutralizing antibodies, the kind that can
block the virus.

But the amount of those antibodies needed to prevent the virus from
returning is unclear. Scientists measure neutralizing antibodies in
titers, an indication of their concentration in the blood.

The three sailors who remained protected from the virus had widely
varying titers; two had only moderate quantities, a finding the
researchers said was reassuring.

``People have been so worried about the titers, and the titers going
down,'' Dr. Alexander Greninger, a virologist at the University of
Washington in Seattle, said.

The results indicate even moderate titers prevented reinfection in a
situation in which exposure to the virus was high, he said: ``These are
attainable titers, right? Hopefully, it'll be helpful to see, and makes
make me very optimistic about the vaccines.''

The American Dynasty carried 113 men and nine women. All crew members
had been tested for both virus and antibodies as part of a routine
screening before setting sail. (The researchers did not have access to
the results from two members.)

The trawler returned to shore after 18 days at sea when a crew member
became ill enough to need hospitalization. The sailors were tested for
the presence of virus and antibodies again and for up to 50 days after
their return.

The three sailors confirmed to have neutralizing antibodies did not test
positive for the virus during the course of the study; 103 of the
remaining 117 became infected.

These numbers may be small, but they're highly significant, Dr.
Greninger said.

``A lot of people, when they see this are like, `Oh come on, it could be
due to random chance,''' he said. In fact, the likelihood that the
results are just chance is extremely low, he added.

    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

Other experts agreed. ``Just looking at the numbers, it becomes clear
that it's unlikely that all of these three people were protected by
chance,'' said Florian Krammer, an immunologist at the Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.

Dr. Krammer and his colleagues are tracking antibody levels in people
who have recovered from the coronavirus once to see at what point they
might be vulnerable to reinfection. The team began with people in New
York, but the virus is circulating at such low levels in the city now
that Dr. Krammer and his colleagues have had to expand the study to
other locations.

Data from vaccine trials also will identify the antibody titers required
to disarm the virus. But in the meantime, ``this is the first evidence
in humans,'' Dr. Krammer said. ``It made my weekend.''

The study raised other questions. Based on the Abbott Architect assay,
six of the 120 people tested before the boat's departure had antibodies
to the virus indicating prior exposure.

But when the researchers reanalyzed those samples using more
sophisticated tests, only three of the six were confirmed to have
antibodies, suggesting that three test results were false positives.

The Abbott test is advertised as returning fewer than one false positive
for every 100 samples. ``That's a little concerning that the Abbott may
be a little less specific than we thought,'' Dr. Tal said.

The researchers also looked at antibodies in the blood, as most teams
do. But those levels may not be the same as those in the nose or in
saliva, the two major entry points for infection, Dr. Tal added.

``We're looking in the wrong place,'' she said. ``If we want to look at
protection from reinfection, we need to be looking in the nose.''
