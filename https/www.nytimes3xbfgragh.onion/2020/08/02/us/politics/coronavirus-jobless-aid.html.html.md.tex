Negotiators acknowledged some progress over the weekend, but said they
remained far apart on a number of issues.

WASHINGTON --- Top Trump administration officials and lawmakers
cautioned on Sunday that a deal over a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/politics/coronavirus-relief-bills-house-senate.html}{new
relief package} to help people and businesses weather the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus}{coronavirus
crisis} remained elusive even as the debate over the details of the aid
was set to take center stage in the coming week.

A meeting on Saturday in the Capitol Hill suite of Speaker Nancy Pelosi
had been the most productive discussion in recent days, officials said,
but they remain divided on a number of issues, including how to revive
lapsed unemployment benefits for tens of millions of Americans and how
broad any deal should be.

``We still have a long ways to go,'' Mark Meadows, the White House chief
of staff, who is negotiating on behalf of the administration, said on
CBS's ``Face the Nation.'' ``I'm not optimistic that there will be a
solution in the very near term.''

He continued to push for Democrats to agree to a stand-alone measure
that would restore the weekly federal jobless benefits, which expired on
Friday, as a way to continue providing relief.

But Ms. Pelosi, who is expected to again meet with administration
officials on Monday, reiterated that she would reject a so-called skinny
bill in favor of a sweeping package that includes a national health
strategy to counter the spread of the virus and extend the full
\$600-a-week unemployment benefit.

She charged that Mr. Meadows and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary,
remained reluctant to commit to a strategic health plan or to address
the needs of American families.

``We have to defeat the virus, and that's one of the contentious issues
that we have to deal with yet,'' Ms. Pelosi said on ABC's ``This Week.''

``We will be close to an agreement when we have an agreement,'' she
added.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/02/us/politics/02dc-cong-pix2/merlin_175197924_15e62e89-559a-4e9a-ad25-c99053583850-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Lawmakers have already approved spending nearly \$3 trillion to address
the public health crisis and economic collapse caused by the pandemic,
but the two parties remain bitterly divided over the scope and cost of
another relief package. Democrats, who remain publicly united behind the
\$3 trillion stimulus measure the House approved in May, contend that
another significant infusion of cash is necessary.

But at least 20 Senate Republicans are unlikely to support any
additional spending, party leaders have acknowledged, in part because of
concerns over the level of spending and its effect on the national debt.
Under a \$1 trillion plan Republicans unveiled on Monday --- a narrower
proposal than the Democrats' plan --- a number of provisions, including
the \$600 weekly federal unemployment benefit, would be severely
curtailed.

``We have to balance --- there's obviously a need to support workers, to
support the economy, people who through no fault of their own are shut
down because of this terrible disease,'' Mr. Mnuchin said on ABC's
``This Week,'' responding to criticism that Republicans took too long to
introduce a proposal. ``On the other hand, we have to be careful about
not piling on enormous amounts of debt for future generations.''

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

``The president is determined to spend what we need to spend,'' he
added, though he criticized Democrats for pushing for close to \$1
trillion in new aid to state and local governments. ``We're moving very
quickly now.''

Ms. Pelosi reiterated on Sunday that her caucus would not accept such a
measure, though she indicated Democrats would be open to an approach
that tied the unemployment benefit to the unemployment rate, lowering
the size of the benefit as the number of people returning to the work
force begins to grow.

The Senate is scheduled to leave for a monthlong recess by the end of
the week, but it is unclear whether lawmakers will be able to reach a
deal by then.

``We're going to work every day until we reach a reasonable agreement
that's good for the American public,'' Mr. Mnuchin said.
