Privately, Chinese doctors say they need outside expertise. But Beijing,
without saying why, has shown no interest so far.

For more than a month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
has been offering to send a team of experts to China to observe its
coronavirus outbreak and help if it can.

Normally, teams from the agency's
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/eis/index.html}{Epidemic Intelligence Service}
can be in the air within 24 hours.

But no invitation has come --- and no one can publicly explain why.

The World Health Organization, which made a similar offer about two
weeks ago, appears to be facing the same cold shoulder, though a
spokeswoman said it is just ``sorting out arrangements.''

Current and former public health officials and diplomats, speaking
anonymously for fear of upsetting diplomatic relations, said they
believe the reluctance comes from China's top leaders, who do not want
the world to think they need outside help.

In 2003, China was badly stung by criticism of its response to SARS,
another coronavirus epidemic; it has also been embroiled in a trade war
with the United States for more than a year.

Some experts also say that outsiders could discover aspects of the
outbreak that are embarrassing to China: for example, the country has
not revealed how many of its doctors and nurses have died fighting the
disease.

But China does need help, experts argue.

In private phone calls and texts, some Chinese colleagues have indicated
that they are overwhelmed and would welcome not just extra hands, but
specialized expertise in a couple of fields.

Also, C.D.C. officials have said that they hope to learn more about the
new coronavirus from their Chinese counterparts to improve the American
response if the virus starts to spread widely here.

On Friday, Alex M. Azar II, secretary of health and human services, said
at a news briefing that he had recently reiterated the offer of a team
to his Chinese counterpart, Dr. Ma Xiaowei.

Asked what the holdup was, he answered: ``It's up to the Chinese. We
continue to expect fully that President Xi will accept our offer. We're
ready and willing and able to go.''

On Jan. 29, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.'s director general,
returned from a brief trip to China full of praise for President Xi
Jinping and the country's extraordinarily aggressive response, which has
nearly walled off Hubei Province from the rest of the country and the
world.

China
\href{https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-audio-script-ncov-rresser-unog-29jan2020.pdf?sfvrsn=a7158807_4}{had
``agreed to a mission of international experts''} to better understand
disease transmission and clinical severity, Dr. Michael Ryan, the
W.H.O's emergency response chief, said at the time.

Asked if that team would include American experts, Dr. Tedros replied
that ``best would be a bilateral arrangement.''

On Thursday, a W.H.O. spokeswoman said that there was no delay in the
organization's own mission to China.

``Our understanding is that the mission is on,'' Marcia Poole, the
spokeswoman, said. But she could not say when the team would leave or
who would be on it.

``It's a matter of sorting out the arrangements,'' she added, noting
that Dr. Ryan had said a team would ``need representation from North and
South, East and West, with relevant areas of expertise.''

The United States has offered Dr. Tedros 13 specialists who are ready to
go, Mr. Azar said.

The two fields in which China appears to need outside help, experts
said, are molecular virology and epidemiology.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

The first involves sequencing the virus's genome and manipulating it to
refine diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccine candidates.

The second involves figuring out basic questions like who gets infected
and who does not, how long the incubation period is, why some victims
die, how many other people each victim infects and how commonly hospital
outbreaks are occurring.

``This isn't rocket science, it's basic stuff --- but it's been five
weeks and we still don't know the answers,'' one expert said.

It would be very useful, for example, to have a blood test for
antibodies. That would make it possible to see how many infected people
had recovered, which would make it clearer as to how lethal the virus is
--- and how widespread.

A major epidemiological failure by China is that the Wuhan authorities
appear to have closed and disinfected the seafood market that was the
outbreak's early focus without swabbing individual animals and their
cages and without drawing blood from everyone working there. That would
have provided a wealth of information about which animal might have been
the source of the coronavirus and which people had become infected but
survived.

Asked what had happened to the animals --- whether they had been burned
or buried, for instance, one expert said: ``No one can tell me that. I
don't think they know.''

China has greatly improved its ability to fight disease since it was
embarrassed by SARS, and its scientists now frequently publish in major
medical journals.

Many of them trained at the American C.D.C. and have friends there.

``We have a decade-long relationship,'' Mr. Azar said Friday. ``It's not
an accident that it's called the Chinese C.D.C.''

Experts raised a related concern: China's scientists are given large
rewards for publishing in prestigious journals. That creates an
incentive to hold back samples and data until publication. Although the
American C.D.C. has in the past sometimes had fraught relations with
other countries because it used their samples and published analyses of
them without giving credit they felt was due, its first priority was
still to issue epidemic warnings if they were needed and then to publish
later.

``In an epidemic, you don't want information held back,'' one expert
said. ``You want transparency.''
