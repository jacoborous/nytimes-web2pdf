\section{When Is Super Tuesday and What Is It
Exactly?}\label{when-is-super-tuesday-and-what-is-it-exactly}}

Super Tuesday is Tuesday, March 3. It is the most important day on the
Democratic primary calendar because there are so many delegates up for
grabs.

When exactly is
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/super-tuesday}{Super
Tuesday}, what makes it so ``Super'' and how did we even get to a place
where we have a day with that title?

Here's what you need to know:

\hypertarget{when-is-super-tuesday}{%
\subsection{When is Super Tuesday?}\label{when-is-super-tuesday}}

Tuesday, March 3.

\hypertarget{what-is-super-tuesday}{%
\subsection{What is Super Tuesday?}\label{what-is-super-tuesday}}

Super Tuesday is the closest thing we have to a national primary. On
March 3, 14 states will hold primaries, as will Democrats Abroad. The
American Samoa Democratic caucuses are also set to take place.

Some of the states that will vote on Super Tuesday, like California and
Texas, have enormous troves of delegates available for the taking. (For
a full list of states that will vote that day, you can view
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/us/elections/2020-presidential-election-calendar.html}{our
2020 election calendar}.) All together, there will be 1,357 delegates to
the national convention at stake --- about a third of the total
available --- and the most offered up on any single day of the primary.

And if you add the 155 delegates allocated from the early voting states
--- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina --- by the time Super
Tuesday has ended, almost 40 percent of the total delegate allocation
will be spoken for.

If one candidate opens a wide delegate lead, it could prove
mathematically difficult for others to climb back into contention. As
such, what happens on Super Tuesday could very well decide the race ---
or come very close to doing so. At the very least, the results that come
out of Super Tuesday could winnow the field.

For a specific look at what is at stake for each major candidate on
Super Tuesday, have a look at our handy guide.

\hypertarget{how-did-we-get-a-super-tuesday}{%
\subsection{How did we get a `Super
Tuesday?'}\label{how-did-we-get-a-super-tuesday}}

If you look at our
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/us/elections/2020-presidential-election-calendar.html}{presidential
primary election calendar}, you'll notice that several of the Democratic
primary contests are being held on Tuesdays. Technically speaking, we
vote in presidential general elections on that day of the week in
November because of
\href{https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/28th-congress/session-2/c28s2ch1.pdf}{a
law that dates back to the 1800s}. And the reason that we settled on
Tuesday had to do with the fact that at the time, America was mostly a
religious and agrarian society.

Sundays were a day of rest and worship and were therefore not good for
voting. Wednesdays were often market day --- the day for selling crops.
And for many farmers, voting in town required travel time, so Mondays
and Thursdays would not work. Thus Tuesdays ended up being one of the
best and only options.

``Super Tuesday,'' however, is a fairly recent political development.
\href{https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1976/05/09/76390315.html?pageNumber=136}{Our
archives contain a reference to ``super-Tuesday'' as early as 1976}, in
a political article that seems to suggest that at least three states
voted in the Democratic primary that year on June 8.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1982/05/02/magazine/the-party-that-lost-its-way.html}{Later
articles} refer to a ``Super Tuesday'' in the Democratic primary of
1980, when on June 3, eight states voted.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1983/06/17/us/briefing-will-tuesday-be-super.html}{One
article explained its genesis this way}:

\begin{quote}
In 1980, Carter-Mondale campaign strategists, wanting to give President
Carter a chance to make a quick rebound should he lose the New Hampshire
primary to his Democratic challenger, Senator Edward M. Kennedy,
arranged to move up the dates of three Southern state primaries to one
week behind the New Hampshire contest. Thus ``Super Tuesday'' was
created in the South, with voters in Georgia, Alabama and Florida
expressing their Presidential preference the same day.
\end{quote}

But what several articles call the ``first'' official Super Tuesday came
on March 13, 1984,
\href{https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1984/03/14/052064.html?pageNumber=37}{when
nine states} --- Washington, Nevada, Oklahoma, Hawaii, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Alabama, Georgia and Florida --- American Samoa and
Democrats abroad all voted. It was ``the largest single harvest of
convention delegates of the campaign,''
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1984/03/14/us/hart-takes-massachusetts-florida-and-rhode-island-mondale-is-strong-in-south.html}{The
Times noted}, adding that 511 delegates were at stake.

That delegate trove would continue to grow over the years in a tradition
that would persist.
