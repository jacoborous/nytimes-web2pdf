Group?}\label{what-is-antifa-the-movement-trump-wants-to-declare-a-terror-group}}

President Trump's announcement brought renewed attention to the
anti-fascist protesters he has blamed for inciting violence at protests.

Seeking to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/31/us/politics/trump-antifa-terrorist-group.html?referringSource=articleShare}{assign
blame for the protests} that have convulsed cities across the country
this week, President Trump
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267129644228247552}{said
on Sunday} that the United States would designate antifa, the loosely
affiliated group of far-left anti-fascism activists, a terrorist
organization.

The president's critics noted, however, that the United States does not
have a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/07/us/domestic-terror-law.html}{domestic
terrorism law} and that antifa, a contraction of the phrase
``anti-fascist,'' is not an organization with a leader, a defined
structure or membership roles.

Rather, antifa is more of a movement of activists whose followers share
a philosophy and tactics. They have made their presence known at
protests around the country in recent years, including the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/13/us/charlottesville-protests-unite-the-right.html}{``Unite
the Right'' rally} in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.

It is impossible to know how many people count themselves as members.
Its followers acknowledge that the movement is secretive, has no
official leaders and is organized into autonomous local cells. It is
also only one in a constellation of activist movements that have come
together in the past few years to oppose the far right.

Antifa members campaign against actions they view as authoritarian,
homophobic, racist or xenophobic. Although antifa is not affiliated with
other movements on the left --- and is sometimes
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/28/opinion/antifa-trump-charlottesville.html}{viewed
as a distraction} by other organizers --- its members sometimes work
with other local activist networks that are rallying around the same
issues, such as the Occupy movement or

\hypertarget{what-are-its-goals}{%
\subsection{What are its goals?}\label{what-are-its-goals}}

Supporters generally seek to stop what they see as fascist, racist and
far-right groups from having a platform to promote their views, arguing
that public demonstration of those ideas leads to the targeting of
marginalized people, including racial minorities, women and members of
the L.G.B.T.Q. community.

``The argument is that militant anti-fascism is inherently self-defense
because of the historically documented violence that fascists pose,
especially to marginalized people,'' said Mark Bray, a history lecturer
at Rutgers University and the author of ``Antifa: The Anti-Fascist
Handbook.''

Many antifa organizers also participate in more peaceful forms of
community organizing, but they believe that using violence is justified
because of their views that if racist or fascist groups are allowed to
organize freely, ``it will inevitably result in violence against
marginalized communities,'' said Mr. Bray, whose defense of the
anti-fascist movement
\href{https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2017/09/dartmouth-and-lecturer-mark-bray-at-center-of-antifa-violence-dispute}{incited
criticism and generated support} at Dartmouth College when he was a
lecturer there.

Although the Merriam-Webster dictionary says the word
``\href{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antifa}{antifa}'' was
first used in 1946 and was borrowed from a German phrase signaling an
opposition to Nazism, more people began
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/17/us/antifa-left-wing-faction-far-right.html}{joining
the movement} in the United States after the 2016 election of Mr. Trump,
to counter the threat they believed was posed by the so-called
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/15/us/politics/alt-left-alt-right-glossary.html}{alt-right},
Mr. Bray said.

One of the first groups in the United States to use the name was
\href{https://www.wweek.com/news/2017/05/23/white-supremacists-are-brawling-with-masked-leftists-in-the-portland-streets-homeland-security-is-watching/}{Rose
City Antifa}, which says it was founded in 2007 in Portland, Ore. It has
a large following on social media, where it shares news articles and
sometimes seeks to dox, or reveal the identities and personal
information of, figures on the right.

The antifa movement gained more visibility in 2017 after a series of
events that put a spotlight on anti-fascist protesters, including the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/21/us/politics/richard-spencer-punched-attack.html}{punching}
of a prominent alt-right member;
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/02/us/university-california-berkeley-free-speech-milo-yiannopoulos.html}{the
cancellation} of an event by a right-wing writer at the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/02/us/university-california-berkeley-free-speech-milo-yiannopoulos.html}{University
of California, Berkeley}; and their confrontation of white nationalist
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/14/us/who-were-the-counterprotesters-in-charlottesville.html}{protesters
in Charlottesville} who turned violent.

\hypertarget{what-distinguishes-antifa-from-other-protest-groups}{%
\subsection{What distinguishes antifa from other protest
groups?}\label{what-distinguishes-antifa-from-other-protest-groups}}

Mr. Bray said antifa groups often use tactics similar to anarchist
groups, such as dressing in all black and wearing masks. The groups also
have overlapping ideologies, as both often criticize capitalism and seek
to dismantle structures of authority, including police forces.

\hypertarget{how-have-politicians-and-others-reacted}{%
\subsection{How have politicians and others
reacted?}\label{how-have-politicians-and-others-reacted}}

The movement has been widely criticized among the mainstream left and
right. After the protests in Berkeley, Calif., in August 2017, Speaker
Nancy Pelosi \href{https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/82917/}{decried}
``the violent actions of people calling themselves antifa'' and said
they should be arrested.

Conservative publications and politicians routinely rail against
supporters of antifa, who they say are seeking to shut down peaceful
expression of conservative views. These critics point to moments during
which purported antifa members have been
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/08/25/a-trump-supporter-was-sucker-punched-by-a-counterprotester-why-isnt-it-a-hate-crime/?utm_term=.9ddfb2a40d3a}{accused
of sucker-punching} Trump supporters.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history at New York University who
studies fascism, said she was worried that antifa's methods could feed
into what she said were false equivalencies that seek to lump violence
on the left with attacks by the right, such as the killing of a
protester in Charlottesville by a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/27/us/james-alex-fields-charlottesville.html}{man
who had expressed white supremacist views}.

``Throwing a milkshake is not equivalent to killing someone, but because
the people in power are allied with the right, any provocation, any
dissent against right-wing violence, backfires,'' Professor Ben-Ghiat
said in an interview last year.

Between 2010 and 2016, 53 percent of terrorist attacks in the United
States were carried out by religious extremists --- 35 percent by
right-wing extremists and 12 percent by left-wing or environmentalist
extremists,
\href{https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_IdeologicalMotivationsOfTerrorismInUS_Nov2017.pdf}{according
to a University of Maryland-led consortium} that studies terrorism.

Militancy on the left can ``become a justification for those in power
and allies on the right to crack down,'' Professor Ben-Ghiat said. ``In
these situations, the left, or antifa, are historically placed in
impossible situations.''
