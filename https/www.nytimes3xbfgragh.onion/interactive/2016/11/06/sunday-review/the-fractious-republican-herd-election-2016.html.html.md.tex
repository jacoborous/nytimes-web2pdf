Here are rough tribal maps of G.O.P. voter groups, based on ideas from a
variety of political consultants and pollsters. Experts do disagree, so
other analysts will prefer their own classifications.

Elephants, or blocs, are scaled to approximate both voter strength and
their levels of animation --- or agitation --- this year.

Almost all Republican voters depicted here will choose Trump. How many
defectors will sit it out or (gasp) vote for Hillary Clinton? We'll know
Tuesday night. Probably.

1

Free-market Optimist Bloc

Open trade, low regulation, low taxes, shrinking government (except
defense). For immigration reform.

Leaders

Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney --- those sometimes called ``governing
conservatives'' and who get headaches from the burn-it-down Freedom
Caucus set; Chamber of Commerce.

Agrees with Libertarians on

Shrinking government, free trade

2

Populist Pessimist/Anti-Washington Bloc

The aggrieved, burn-it-down heart of the Tea Party and Trump's support:
anti-trade, anti-immigrant, anti-establishment (both politics and
business). Many are blue collar, hit hard by the evolving economy. Less
educated and largely white. Receptive to claims that politics and
elections are rigged. Think America reached its zenith in the 1950s, and
it's been downhill ever since.

Leaders

House Freedom Caucus; Stephen K. Bannon, Trump campaign chief; Sean
Hannity

Agrees with Biblical Bloc and Cultural Protectionist Bloc on

Anti-immigration, an intense dislike of Obama, slashing federal
spending, destroying Obamacare
