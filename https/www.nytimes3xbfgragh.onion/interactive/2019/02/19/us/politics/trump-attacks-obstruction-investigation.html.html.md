<span id="g-0" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">I don't know Putin, have no
deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a
deal with Iran, \#1 in terror, no problem\!</span>
<span id="g-1" class="g-quote g-media">The fake news media is going
crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are
unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great\!</span>
<span id="g-2" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">This Russian connection
non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in
Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.</span>
<span id="g-3" class="g-quote g-media">Information is being illegally
given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence
community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia</span>
<span id="g-4" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">Thank you to Eli Lake of The
Bloomberg View - "The NSA & FBI...should not interfere in our
politics...and is" Very serious situation for USA</span>
<span id="g-5" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Crimea was TAKEN by Russia
during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?</span>
<span id="g-6" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">The real scandal here is that
classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like
candy. Very un-American\!</span>
<span id="g-7" class="g-quote g-media">Leaking, and even illegal
classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years.
Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize\!</span>
<span id="g-8" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">The spotlight has finally been
put on the low-life leakers\! They will be caught\!</span>
<span id="g-9" class="g-quote g-media">FAKE NEWS media, which makes up
stories and "sources," is far more effective than the discredited
Democrats - but they are fading fast\!</span>
<span id="g-10" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">The Democrats had to come up
with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so
they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news\!</span>
<span id="g-11" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">The FBI is totally unable to
stop the national security "leakers" that have permeated our government
for a long time. They can't even......</span>
<span id="g-12" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">find the leakers within the FBI
itself. Classified information is being given to media that could have a
devastating effect on U.S. FIND NOW</span>
<span id="g-13" class="g-quote g-media">Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out
by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big
election defeat and the illegal leaks\!</span>
<span id="g-14" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...intentional. This whole
narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that
everyone thought they were supposed.....</span>
<span id="g-15" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...to win. The Democrats are
overplaying their hand. They lost the election, and now they have lost
their grip on reality. The real story...</span>
<span id="g-16" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">...is all of the illegal leaks
of classified and other information. It is a total "witch hunt\!"</span>
<span id="g-17" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">The first meeting Jeff
Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration
under education program for 100 Ambs......</span>
<span id="g-18" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Terrible\! Just found out
that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory.
Nothing found. This is McCarthyism\!</span>
<span id="g-19" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Just out: The same Russian
Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22
times, and 4 times last year alone.</span>
<span id="g-20" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Is it legal for a sitting
President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an
election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW\!</span>
<span id="g-21" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">I'd bet a good lawyer
could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping
my phones in October, just prior to Election\!</span>
<span id="g-22" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">How low has President
Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process.
This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy\!</span>
<span id="g-23" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Is it true the DNC would not
allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning
it was hacked? Can that be possible?</span>
<span id="g-24" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Who was it that secretly
said to Russian President, "Tell Vladimir that after the election I'll
have more flexibility?" @foxandfriends</span>
<span id="g-25" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">For eight years Russia
"ran over" President Obama, got stronger and stronger, picked-off Crimea
and added missiles. Weak\! @foxandfriends</span>
<span id="g-26" class="g-quote g-media">James Clapper and others stated
that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE
NEWS and everyone knows it\!</span>
<span id="g-27" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">The Democrats made up and
pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign.
Big advantage in Electoral College & lost\!</span>
<span id="g-28" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">The real story that Congress,
the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of
Classified information. Must find leaker now\!</span>
<span id="g-29" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">What about all of the
contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true
that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?</span>
<span id="g-30" class="g-quote g-media">Just watched the totally biased
and fake news reports of the so-called Russia story on NBC and ABC. Such
dishonesty\!</span> <span id="g-31" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Why
isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary
deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech....</span>
<span id="g-32" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...money to Bill, the
Hillary Russian "reset," praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian
Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. \#MAGA\!</span>
<span id="g-33" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Watch @foxandfriends now on
Podesta and Russia\!</span>
<span id="g-34" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Why doesn't Fake News talk
about Podesta ties to Russia as covered by @FoxNews or money from Russia
to Clinton - sale of Uranium?</span>
<span id="g-35" class="g-quote g-media">Mike Flynn should ask for
immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by
media & Dems, of historic proportion\!</span>
<span id="g-36" class="g-quote g-media">When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd
and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop
with the Fake Trump/Russia story?</span>
<span id="g-37" class="g-quote g-media">It is the same Fake News Media
that said there is "no path to victory for Trump" that is now pushing
the phony Russia story. A total scam\!</span>
<span id="g-38" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Wow, @FoxNews just
reporting big news. Source: "Official behind unmasking is high up. Known
Intel official is responsible. Some unmasked....</span>
<span id="g-39" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">..not associated with
Russia. Trump team spied on before he was nominated." If this is true,
does not get much bigger. Would be sad for U.S.</span>
<span id="g-40" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">The real story turns out to be
SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING\! Find the leakers.</span>
<span id="g-41" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Such amazing reporting on
unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. "Spied on
before nomination." The real story.</span>
<span id="g-42" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Was the brother of John
Podesta paid big money to get the sanctions on Russia lifted? Did
Hillary know?</span>
<span id="g-43" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">.@FoxNews from multiple
sources: "There was electronic surveillance of Trump, and people close
to Trump. This is unprecedented." @FBI</span>
<span id="g-44" class="g-quote g-comey">FBI Director Comey was the best
thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free
pass for many bad deeds\! The phony...</span>
<span id="g-45" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...Trump/Russia story was an
excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election.
Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?</span>
<span id="g-46" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Susan Rice, the former
National Security Advisor to President Obama, is refusing to testify
before a Senate Subcommittee next week on.....</span>
<span id="g-47" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">...allegations of
unmasking Trump transition officials. Not good\!</span>
<span id="g-48" class="g-quote g-media">When will the Fake Media ask
about the Dems dealings with Russia & why the DNC wouldn't allow the FBI
to check their server or investigate?</span>
<span id="g-49" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">General Flynn was given
the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the
Fake News seldom likes talking about that.</span>
<span id="g-50" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if
she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after
she explained it to W.H. Counsel.</span>
<span id="g-51" class="g-quote g-media">Director Clapper reiterated what
everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is "no
evidence" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.</span>
<span id="g-52" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">Sally Yates made the fake media
extremely unhappy today --- she said nothing but old news\!</span>
<span id="g-53" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">The Russia-Trump
collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade
end?</span> <span id="g-54" class="g-quote g-media">Biggest story today
between Clapper & Yates is on surveillance. Why doesn't the media report
on this? \#FakeNews\!</span>
<span id="g-55" class="g-quote g-comey">Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated
recently, "I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer."
Then acts so indignant. \#draintheswamp</span>
<span id="g-56" class="g-quote g-comey">The Democrats have said some of
the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be
fired, but now they play so sad\!</span>
<span id="g-57" class="g-quote g-comey">James Comey will be replaced by
someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and
prestige of the FBI.</span>
<span id="g-58" class="g-quote g-comey">Comey lost the confidence of
almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When
things calm down, they will be thanking me\!</span>
<span id="g-59" class="g-quote g-comey">Watching Senator Richard
Blumenthal speak of Comey is a joke. "Richie" devised one of the
greatest military frauds in U.S. history. For....</span>
<span id="g-60" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">years, as a pol in
Connecticut, Blumenthal would talk of his great bravery and conquests in
Vietnam - except he was never there. When....</span>
<span id="g-61" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">caught, he cried like a
baby and begged for forgiveness...and now he is judge & jury. He should
be the one who is investigated for his acts.</span>
<span id="g-62" class="g-quote g-media">The Roger Stone report on @CNN
is false - Fake News. Have not spoken to Roger in a long time - had
nothing to do with my decision.</span>
<span id="g-63" class="g-quote g-comey">Dems have been complaining for
months & months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they
PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites\!</span>
<span id="g-64" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Russia must be laughing up
their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat
EXCUSE for losing the election.</span>
<span id="g-65" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Again, the story that there
was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by
Dems as an excuse for losing the election.</span>
<span id="g-66" class="g-quote g-comey">James Comey better hope that
there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to
the press\!</span> <span id="g-67" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">When
James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the
witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?</span>
<span id="g-68" class="g-quote g-comey">I have been asking Director
Comey & others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the
LEAKERS in the intelligence community.....</span>
<span id="g-69" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">This is the single
greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history\!</span>
<span id="g-70" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">With all of the illegal
acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration,
there was never a special counsel appointed\!</span>
<span id="g-71" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Russian officials must be
laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the
election has taken over the Fake News.</span>
<span id="g-72" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">So now it is reported
that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don't
want him to testify. He blows away their....</span>
<span id="g-73" class="g-quote g-comey">...case against him & now wants
to clear his name by showing "the false or misleading testimony by James
Comey, John Brennan..." Witch Hunt\!</span>
<span id="g-74" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Crooked Hillary Clinton now
blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible
candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC.</span>
<span id="g-75" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">The big story is the
"unmasking and surveillance" of people that took place during the Obama
Administration.</span> <span id="g-76" class="g-quote g-comey">I believe
the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever
thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly\!'</span>
<span id="g-77" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">A.G. Lynch made law
enforcement decisions for political purposes...gave Hillary Clinton a
free pass and protection. Totally illegal\!</span>
<span id="g-78" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">They made up a phony
collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for
obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice</span>
<span id="g-79" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">You are witnessing the
single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some
very bad and conflicted people\! \#MAGA</span>
<span id="g-80" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Why is that Hillary Clintons
family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my
non-dealings are?</span>
<span id="g-81" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Crooked H destroyed phones
w/ hammer, 'bleached' emails, & had husband meet w/AG days before she
was cleared- & they talk about obstruction?</span>
<span id="g-82" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">After 7 months of
investigations & committee hearings about my "collusion with the
Russians," nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad\!</span>
<span id="g-83" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">Despite the phony Witch
Hunt going on in America, the economic & jobs numbers are great.
Regulations way down, jobs and enthusiasm way up\!</span>
<span id="g-84" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">I am being investigated for
firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI
Director\! Witch Hunt</span>
<span id="g-85" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">Former Homeland
Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to
state there was no grand scheme between Trump & Russia.</span>
<span id="g-86" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">By the way, if Russia was
working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama
Admin. Why didn't they stop them?</span>
<span id="g-87" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...Why did Democratic
National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks
(long prior to election). It's all a big Dem HOAX\!</span>
<span id="g-88" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...Why did the DNC REFUSE to
turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem
scam and excuse for losing the election\!</span>
<span id="g-89" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">With all of the recently
reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal
leaking of information, I have no idea...</span>
<span id="g-90" class="g-quote g-comey">...whether there are "tapes" or
recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and
do not have, any such recordings.</span>
<span id="g-91" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Just out: The Obama
Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election
meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?</span>
<span id="g-92" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Since the Obama
Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians
were meddling, why no action? Focus on them, not T\!</span>
<span id="g-93" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Obama Administration
official said they "choked" when it came to acting on Russian meddling
of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?</span>
<span id="g-94" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">The reason that President
Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of
meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..</span>
<span id="g-95" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">...and did not want to
"rock the boat." He didn't "choke," he colluded or obstructed, and it
did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.</span>
<span id="g-96" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">The real story is that
President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian
meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...</span>
<span id="g-97" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">..under a magnifying
glass, they have zero "tapes" of T people colluding. There is no
collusion & no obstruction. I should be given apology\!</span>
<span id="g-98" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">From @FoxNews "Bombshell:
In 2016, Obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an American
election." Check out his statement - Witch Hunt\!</span>
<span id="g-99" class="g-quote g-media">Wow, CNN had to retract big
story on "Russia," with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the
other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS\!</span>
<span id="g-100" class="g-quote g-media">Fake News CNN is looking at big
management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony
Russian stories. Ratings way down\!</span>
<span id="g-101" class="g-quote g-media">So they caught Fake News CNN
cold, but what about NBC, CBS & ABC? What about the failing @nytimes &
@washingtonpost? They are all Fake News\!</span>
<span id="g-102" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Everyone here is talking
about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the
CIA. Disgraceful\!</span>
<span id="g-103" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">...and safe. Questions were
asked about why the CIA & FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their
SERVER, and were rejected, still don't....</span>
<span id="g-104" class="g-quote g-media">...have it. Fake News said 17
intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize). Why did Obama do
NOTHING when he had info before election?</span>
<span id="g-105" class="g-quote g-comey">James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal\!</span>
<span id="g-106" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">My son Donald did a
good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the
greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad\!</span>
<span id="g-107" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">.@WashTimes states
"Democrats have willfully used Moscow disinformation to influence the
presidential election against Donald Trump."</span>
<span id="g-108" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Why aren't the same
standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have
gotten away with. Disgraceful\!</span>
<span id="g-109" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">HillaryClinton can
illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my
son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?</span>
<span id="g-110" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">Thank you to former
campaign adviser Michael Caputo for saying so powerfully that there was
no Russian collusion in our winning campaign.</span>
<span id="g-111" class="g-quote g-comey">A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from
the Amazon Washington Post,this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions.These
illegal leaks, like Comey's, must stop\!</span>
<span id="g-112" class="g-quote g-media">While all agree the U. S.
President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only
crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS</span>
<span id="g-113" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">So many people are asking why
isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or
Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?</span>
<span id="g-114" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...What about all of the
Clinton ties to Russia, including Podesta Company, Uranium deal, Russian
Reset, big dollar speeches etc.</span>
<span id="g-115" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">My son Donald openly gave
his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton
deleted (& acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails\!</span>
<span id="g-116" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">As the phony Russian
Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost
election taking hold, Democrats and Russians\!</span>
<span id="g-117" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">After 1 year of
investigation with Zero evidence being found, Chuck Schumer just stated
that "Democrats should blame ourselves,not Russia."</span>
<span id="g-118" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">So why aren't the Committees
and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into
Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?</span>
<span id="g-119" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">Sleazy Adam Schiff,
the totally biased Congressman looking into "Russia," spends all of his
time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse\!</span>
<span id="g-120" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">Ukrainian efforts to sabotage
Trump campaign - "quietly working to boost Clinton." So where is the
investigation A.G. @seanhannity</span>
<span id="g-121" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">Attorney General Jeff Sessions
has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are

The attacks, which number nearly 1,200, are part of [a strategy to beat
back the
investigations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-investigations.html).
They have also opened him to [possible obstruction of justice

They include statements made on Twitter, in official speeches, at

While it is highly unusual for anyone — let alone the president of the

Trump has done so at least once on 330 days, or more than 43 percent of
his time in office as of Feb. 14.

Trump has described Paul Manafort, his onetime campaign chairman — who
has been convicted of 10 felonies and is awaiting sentencing — as a
“very decent man” and “honorable person.”

<div class="g-item g-text">

The president has also said he felt “badly” for Michael T. Flynn, his
former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the
F.B.I.

<div class="g-item g-text">

Mr. Trump praised Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime associate who has
pleaded not guilty to felony charges in the special counsel
investigation, for having “guts” for saying he would refuse to testify
against him.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

And Mr. Trump called his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., a “good boy” who
did nothing wrong in arranging a meeting at Trump Tower with a
Kremlin-connected lawyer who promised damaging information on Mrs.
Clinton.
