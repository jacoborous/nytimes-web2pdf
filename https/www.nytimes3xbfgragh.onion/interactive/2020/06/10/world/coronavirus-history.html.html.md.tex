Only the worst disasters completely upend normal patterns of death,
overshadowing, if only briefly, everyday causes like cancer, heart
disease and car accidents. Here's how the devastation brought by the
pandemic in 25 cities and regions compares with historical events.

Normal mortality

A wave of homicides devastated Chicago in 2016. But it caused only a
small increase in overall mortality in the city.

A bad flu season in New York City raised all deaths to 1.05 times higher
than during a normal winter.

Neither event nears the extraordinary wave of death during the
coronavirus pandemic. We compared deaths in the worst months of the
outbreak to past years, a measure often used to assess a disaster's
severity.

Even in Oslo, which has avoided a major outbreak, about 15 percent more
people died than normal --- rivaling the worst month of the AIDS
epidemic in New York City.

The outbreak's death toll in Miami rivals that of one of America's worst
recent flu seasons in Seattle.

Hurricane Maria killed thousands of people in Puerto Rico in 2017. Many
died after widespread power outages overwhelmed hospitals. The increase
in death was similar to the outbreak's toll in Brazil's two largest
cities.

Demographers call these ``mortality shocks'' --- sudden spikes in the
total number of people dying not seen in the weeks before an event, and
not likely to last once it is over. They're often found during natural
disasters, severe flu seasons, famines or wars.

Nearly 3,000 people in New York City died in a single day on Sept. 11,
2001. It was one of the largest mortality shocks in recent American
history. Sixty percent more people died that September than normal.

On a relative scale, deaths increased more in Denver in March.

Death during the outbreak is often less visible than death from a
terrorist attack or a natural disaster. Many people have died quietly,
in nursing homes or at home. And some die without being tested and are
excluded from official death counts.

These estimates include all deaths, offering a more complete accounting
of the outbreak's toll than official tallies. They include people who
died directly from the coronavirus and those who died from other causes
as hospitals have been stretched and people avoid seeking medical care.

The 1957 flu pandemic, also known as the Asian flu, killed at least one
million people worldwide. In Santiago, Chile, one of the worst-hit
cities, mortality doubled. That increase was only a little higher than
the one during the coronavirus in Detroit.

2x normal mortality

Any disaster past this line ---~that is, one in which normal deaths
double ---~should be declared an emergency, according to guidelines from
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Sweden kept schools and businesses open as most of Europe closed them
and ordered citizens to stay home. The country has seen an extraordinary
increase in deaths, especially in Stockholm. More than twice the usual
number of people died there in April.

While national figures can broadly show the situation in each country,
they can also obscure acute crises in densely populated cities, like
Boston, where the virus spread rapidly before officials told people to
stay home.

``If you're looking at the total impact of the pandemic across an entire
country, it may not seem like much is going on,'' said Robert Anderson,
chief of the mortality statistics branch at the C.D.C.'s National Center
for Health Statistics. ``If you really want to know what's happening,
you need to look at states, cities and local areas.''

Major cities with large outbreaks, like Paris, have rates of excess
death far higher than the rest of their countries.

3x normal mortality

Few places have seen excess deaths of this scale --- more than three
times normal.

Now we see Boston's toll during the 1918 flu, also known as the Spanish
flu, the worst pandemic of the 20th century. It killed at least 50
million people worldwide, with about 675,000 deaths in the United
States.

As the toll has eased in New York and in European capitals, cities
across Latin America have begun to see astonishing increases in deaths.
Deaths spiked in Lima in April despite a strict lockdown. More than
11,000 people died in May, about 8,000 more people than in previous
years. That surpasses the worst month of the 1918 flu in New York City.

4x normal mortality

These figures reflect deaths only through May. In many cities in Latin
America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East, the outbreak is still getting
worse.

``Oh my goodness,'' Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the United States' top
infectious disease expert, said on Tuesday. ``Where is it going to end?
We're still at the beginning of it.''

In Madrid, more than 14,000 people died between mid-March and mid-April.
The city usually sees around 3,000 deaths during this period.

5x normal mortality

Few places ever see excess deaths of this scale outside of famine or
war.

The death toll in Ecuador --- one of the worst in the world --- was far
higher than the official number of Covid-19 deaths reported by the
government. In Guayas, a coastal province that includes the city of
Guayaquil, deaths spiked by more than five times.

New York City, long the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, has experienced
one of the most extreme increases in deaths. Mortality in April grew to
almost six times the usual number.

6x normal mortality

Bergamo, a province in northern Italy of just under one million people,
usually sees fewer than 1,000 deaths each month. But during the peak of
its outbreak in March, nearly 6,000 people died. It may be the
hardest-hit place in the world, so far.

A 9.0-magnitude earthquake set off a tsunami that sent waves crashing
through coastal cities in northern Japan. It killed more than 11,000
people in Miyagi Prefecture that month.

This is not an exhaustive list of disasters. Many wars, famines and
other events in the last century have caused even greater increases in
death.

7x normal mortality

The Spanish flu outbreak in Philadelphia was deadlier than the current
pandemic in any known city so far. In October 1918, almost 15,000 people
in the city died, an extraordinary number of deaths for that time.

The coronavirus is unlikely to kill as many people as the Spanish flu
did, but in the modern history of natural disasters, it will have few
rivals.

*The data in the U.S. accounts for 86 percent of the population.

and Manuela Andreoni from Rio de Janeiro.

\textbf{About the data:} The all-cause mortality data obtained from each
city varies: Some cities publish daily death totals dating back decades,
and others only for the last few years. Places with less historical
data, such as Istanbul, make for rougher historical comparisons.
Historical baselines used to calculate excess deaths do not adjust for
any expected reduction in recent deaths from non-Covid-19 causes or for
two deadly flu epidemics in Europe during the winters of 2014-15 and
2017-18.
