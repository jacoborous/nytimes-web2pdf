The 45th president, a deeply divisive leader, was running for
re-election on immigration, trade and the economy. Then the coronavirus
crisis hit.

73 years old

Born in Queens; recently changed his primary residence from Manhattan to
Palm Beach, Fla.

45th president of the United States

Former reality show host and New York City real estate developer who
never ran for political office until his 2016 presidential campaign

\hypertarget{trumps-signature-issues}{%
\subsection{Trump's signature issues}\label{trumps-signature-issues}}

Mr. Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic has not been a defining
issue of his presidency for long, but how his administration has
responded is likely to be critical not only to his legacy, but also to
how some swing voters who are open to both him and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.} make their decision in November.

Before the coronavirus crisis consumed his White House, his 2016
rallying cry of ``build the wall'' still echoed in his re-election
campaign. Construction of a wall along the country's southern border,
intended to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/08/us/border-wall-texas.html}{has
been slow going}, but an immigration crackdown has remained one of the
policy issues that enlivens his base. Mr. Trump has even tried to use
immigration as a way to change the subject from criticism of his
administration's handling of the pandemic.

Mr. Trump has also made eliminating federal regulations a priority, with
a focus on
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html}{dismantling
Obama-era environmental regulations}. So far, he has failed to achieve
his top legislative priority when he came into office:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/01/health/unconstitutional-trump-aca.html}{repealing
the Affordable Care Act}. But he has pleased Republicans, in particular,
with his commitment to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/14/us/trump-appeals-court-judges.html}{appointing
conservative judges} to the federal bench at a record-setting pace.

Mr. Trump touts two trade deals as his signature policies, even as they
mark a break from Republican free-trade **** orthodoxy in favor of a
populist approach: an initial trade agreement
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/15/business/economy/china-trade-deal.html}{with
China}, and his revised accord
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/01/us/politics/trump-trade-deal-usmca.html}{with
Mexico
and}\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/01/us/politics/trump-trade-deal-usmca.html}{Canada}.
His foreign policy doctrine can be summed up by the phrase
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/21/us/politics/trump-mattis-american-first-foreign-policy.html}{``America
First},'' a banner under which Mr. Trump has over the years questioned
the founding tenets of alliances like NATO, and demonstrated a
reluctance to engage in overseas military operations.

Trump}\label{three-questions-about-donald-trump}}

\hypertarget{1-is-donald-trump-under-investigation}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{1. Is Donald Trump under
investigation?}}{1. Is Donald Trump under investigation?}}\label{1-is-donald-trump-under-investigation}}

For almost the first time in his presidency, the answer appears to be
no. The first two years of his administration were defined by the
looming investigation of the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who
in March 2019 wrapped up
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/24/us/politics/mueller-report-summary.html}{his
report on Russian interference in the 2016 election}. Mr. Mueller did
not reach a conclusion on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed
justice, but found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the
Trump campaign and Russia.

Mr. Trump
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeached.html}{was
impeached} by the House of Representatives months after the Russia
investigation concluded, for seeking to pressure Ukraine to smear his
political rivals. In February, after five months of hearings, Mr. Trump
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/05/us/politics/trump-acquitted-impeachment.html}{was
acquitted} in the Senate, along party lines, of abuse of power and
obstruction of Congress.

hinge on the
virus?}}{2. Will Mr. Trump's re-election hinge on the virus?}}\label{2-will-mr-trumps-re-election-hinge-on-the-virus}}

Many aides and allies have been making the case to Mr. Trump that he is
no longer running against a political opponent, but rather against the
virus, and that his re-election in November depends on convincing voters
that his administration's response saved lives.

Through daily White House news conferences, Mr. Trump has been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/26/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-briefings-analyzed.html}{trying
to reshape the narrative} and convince voters that his response to the
health crisis was adequate, despite the fact that he repeatedly played
down the threat of the virus and was slow to absorb the scale of the
risk. He has also been eager to restart the economy, so that he can
claim credit for the economic gains that he was running on before the
virus washed them away, while pinning the blame for the spread of the
virus elsewhere, like on China or the World Health Organization.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{3. How much is Donald Trump
worth?}}{3. How much is Donald Trump worth?}}\label{3-how-much-is-donald-trump-worth}}

Mr. Trump, famous for telling falsehoods and making inflated claims
about himself, has long claimed to be a billionaire. The question of how
much Mr. Trump is really worth has been a moving target, and one he
refuses to answer. He has continued to refuse to release his tax
returns, and it's now a battle being fought in the courts.

He has tried to shield his tax returns from Manhattan state prosecutors,
an effort that was rejected by a federal judge. The Justice Department
has helped his attempt to block a subpoena demanding the release of
eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns.
