The former vice president, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, says
he can build on the Obama legacy and unite the country in a challenging
time.

\subsection{Who is Joe Biden?}\label{who-is-joe-biden}}

77 years old

Born in Scranton, Pa.; lives in Wilmington, Del.

Six-term senator from Delaware first elected in 1972; 47th vice
president of the United States

Also sought the Democratic nomination for president in '88 and '08

\subsection{Biden's signature issues}\label{bidens-signature-issues}}

Mr. Biden, who has served in public life for around a half-century, is
emphasizing his government experience, seeking to cast himself as a
steady, seasoned hand in a dangerous and uncertain world.

As the coronavirus crisis has unfolded, he has looked for ways to help
voters picture him as commander in chief, formulating recommendations
rooted in advice from health care and economics experts. Those
suggestions include making coronavirus tests broadly accessible, and
free. He has said there should be no out-of-pocket cost for patients to
receive an eventual vaccine, either. And he has been sharply critical of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html}{President
Trump}'s response to the virus, accusing him of reacting too slowly.

Mr. Biden served as vice president in the Obama administration during
the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and health care remains a top
priority for him. It's an issue he often discusses in the context of his
family's personal tragedies: He lost his first wife and an infant
daughter in a car accident in 1972, and in 2015, his son Beau Biden died
of brain cancer. Health care, he said
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/27/us/politics/joe-biden-ad-personal.html}{in
an early television ad}, is ``personal'' to him. He supports adding a
public option to the Affordable Care Act, but opposes ``Medicare for
all,'' the sweeping single-payer measure advocated by some progressives
in his party, including Senator Bernie Sanders.

Mr. Biden, who served for decades in the Senate, firmly believes in the
value of bipartisanship and insists on extending overtures to
Republicans even in a moment when many in his own party don't see
negotiating partners on the other side. As a former chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he also speaks passionately about
asserting and defending America's role as a leader on the global stage.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/29/us/politics/joe-biden-age.html}{Yes}.
He would be the oldest president in history at his inauguration, at age
78. Mr. Trump, who is currently 73, would also be the oldest president
ever if he wins a second term.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{2. Where is Joe Biden
from?}}{2. Where is Joe Biden from?}}\label{2-where-is-joe-biden-from}}

Mr. Biden was born in Scranton, Pa., in 1942, and moved to Delaware as a
child. As a politician, he has maintained close political ties to both
states, though Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Biden of having ``deserted''
Pennsylvania.

``I was in third grade,'' Mr. Biden

back}\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/28/us/politics/trump-biden-north-korea.html}{.}

He continues to maintain strong ties to Pennsylvania, a critical general
election battleground that Mr. Trump won in 2016, and he has based his
campaign headquarters in Philadelphia.

play in Joe Biden's
campaign?}}{3. What role does the Obama era play in Joe Biden's campaign?}}\label{3-what-role-does-the-obama-era-play-in-joe-bidens-campaign}}

A big one. Mr. Obama did not endorse Mr. Biden until the primary race
was settled, but he and Mr. Biden
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/16/us/politics/biden-obama-history.html}{forged
a close relationship in his administration}. Mr. Biden talks about their
friendship frequently, as well as the work they did together on issues
ranging from health care to foreign policy.

Throughout the primary, some of Mr. Biden's biggest applause at campaign
events came as he praised Mr. Obama. And many Democratic voters,
especially African-American voters, have cited his relationship with Mr.
Obama and nostalgia for that administration in explaining their current
support for Mr. Biden. Now that the primary is over, Mr. Biden is also
focused on winning the enthusiastic support of Democrats who supported
other candidates and are lukewarm toward his candidacy --- and his
campaign must also think about engaging independent voters and moderate
Republicans.
