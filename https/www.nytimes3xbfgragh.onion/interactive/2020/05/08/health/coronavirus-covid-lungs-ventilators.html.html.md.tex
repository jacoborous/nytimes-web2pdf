Ventilators have become the single most important piece of medical
equipment for critically ill coronavirus patients whose damaged lungs
prevent them from getting enough oxygen to vital organs. The machines
work by forcing air deep into the lungs, dislodging the fluid and
accumulated pus that interfere with the exchange of oxygen, a process
orchestrated by tiny air sacs known as alveoli.

Lungs are complex organs that deliver oxygen to the bloodstream and keep
organs functioning.

Ventilators are not a cure for Covid-19 patients, but mechanical
breathing assistance can keep patients alive while they battle the
infection.

Critical care ventilators are more than just air pumps. They are finely
tuned machines with software that must be constantly adjusted by skilled
medical workers to ensure that patients receive the right combination of
oxygen level, pressure, breath volume and breathing rate.

\subsection{\ldots{} but ventilating a patient is far from a guaranteed
fix.}\label{-but-ventilating-a-patient-is-far-from-a-guaranteed-fix}}

Non-coronavirus patients on ventilators have about a 50 percent survival
rate. The mortality rate for coronavirus patients on ventilators is not
yet clear --- in part because, with no proven method of treatment for
the virus, coronavirus patients are often being kept on these machines
for weeks in order to keep them breathing long enough to give their
lungs a chance to heal.

Intubation is fraught. Patients must be heavily sedated to allow doctors
to insert a breathing tube into the lungs --- and to prevent them from
waking up and pulling out the tubes. Because too much air pressure can
damage the lungs, intubated patients must be constantly monitored.

Fears of a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/08/nyregion/ventilators-fema-coronavirus-cuomo.html}{ventilator
shortage in New York} and the poor prognosis for intubated patients have
helped spur
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/health/ventilators-coronavirus.html}{innovations
for sustaining patients} without relying on critical care ventilators.

Health care providers have embraced a maneuver that has long been used
for ventilated patients --- periodically turning them on their stomach
to increase lung capacity. Proning, as it's called, opens up areas of
the lungs that are normally compressed by the weight of the heart when
lying on one's back. Doctors are currently studying whether using
proning for some patients in respiratory distress can allow them to
recover without being placed on ventilators.

Flipping over patients in acute respiratory distress, doctors have
discovered, can markedly increase oxygenation. The process can be
labor-intensive, however, requiring staff to turn over patients several
times a day.

\hypertarget{-and-less-expensive-treatment-alternatives}{%
\subsection{... and less expensive treatment
alternatives.}\label{-and-less-expensive-treatment-alternatives}}

Medical workers have increasingly turned to CPAP and BiPAP machines,
inexpensive air pumps used by millions of Americans with sleep apnea,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other breathing disorders.
Hospitals have been repurposing unused machines and using them both with
or without intubation to send pressurized air into the lungs of
coronavirus patients.

To reduce the risk of infection for hospital workers, doctors have also
been fitting patients with jury-rigged helmets that deliver oxygen via
CPAP machines while filtering out exhaled viral particles. The helmets
were pioneered by Italian doctors forced to improvise because of a
shortage of intensive care ventilators.
