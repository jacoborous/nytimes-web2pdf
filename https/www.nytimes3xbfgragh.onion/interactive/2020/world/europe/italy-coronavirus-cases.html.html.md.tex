There have been at least 248,400 confirmed cases of coronavirus in
Italy, according to the
\href{https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19}{Italian Department of Civil
Protection}. As of Tuesday afternoon, 35,171 people had died.

About this data For total cases and deaths: The map shows the known
locations of coronavirus cases by region. Circles are sized by the
number of people there who have tested positive or have a probable case
of the virus, which may differ from where they contracted the illness.

Here's how the number of new known cases and deaths are growing across
Italy's provinces.

Once the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/21/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-center-lessons.html}{center
of the pandemic in Europe}, Italy has kept the epidemic in check for
months and has gradually loosened its lockdown provisions. Restaurants,
bars, shops and hairdressers reopened in May, and gyms, museums, spas
and most gathering places were given a green light in June --- as long
as they observe social distancing rules and strict hygiene protocols.

The government also allowed theaters and cinemas to reopen, provided
they keep people one meter apart and limit audiences to 200 indoors and
1,000 outdoors. Religious celebrations have been reinstated, as long as
the faithful remain socially distant. Masks are compulsory across the
country in all public indoor spaces.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy was ``facing a calculated
risk'' by loosening the lockdown, citing recent data suggesting that
infection rates remained low even after Italians began to ease out of
lockdown. But the government was aware ``that the epidemiological curve
could go back up'' --- as it has in Belgium and Spain.

On June 3, the Italian government dropped travel restrictions to and
from European Union member states, Schengen area countries and the
United Kingdom. As of July 1, travelers from Australia, Canada, New
Zealand and

other countries are now permitted}. Visitors from 16 other countries,
including Bangladesh, Brazil and Serbia, cannot enter the country until
July 31.

The New York Times has found that official

in the United States} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html}{in
more than a dozen other countries} have undercounted deaths during the
coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.

Daily data at the regional and provincial level is provided by the
Italian Department of Civil Protection in
\href{http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html\#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1}{Italian}
and \href{https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19}{English}. The data
includes the number of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, hospitalized
patients and the number of people in intensive care. The data on the
number of ``swabs'' undertaken each day reflects the number of tests
performed, and the Civil Protection has recently started providing the
number of people tested as
well.\href{https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/generale/2020/03/23/news/coronavirus_borrelli_i_numeri_sono_altri_l_epidemia_va_piu_veloce_della_nostra_burocrazia_-252124440/?ref=RHPPTP-BH-I252124970-C12-P3-S1.12-T1}{}

that the number of cases could be as much as ten times higher than the
current figure. A
\href{https://www.istat.it/it/files//2020/05/Rapporto_Istat_ISS.pdf}{new
study} by Italy's national statistics agency strongly suggests that many
more Italians may have died from the coronavirus than the official
numbers indicate.

\hypertarget{about-the-data}{%
\subsection{About the data}\label{about-the-data}}

\textbf{Confirmed cases and deaths} are counts of individuals whose
coronavirus infections were confirmed by a laboratory test.
\textbf{Probable cases and deaths} count individuals who did not have a
confirmed test but were evaluated using criteria developed by national
and local governments. Some governments are reporting only confirmed
cases, while others are reporting both confirmed and probable numbers.
And there is also another set of governments that are reporting the two
types of numbers combined without providing a way to separate the
confirmed from the probable. The Times is now using the total of
confirmed and probable counts when they are available individually or
combined. Otherwise only the confirmed count will be shown.

Governments often revise data or report a large increase in cases on a
single day without historical revisions, which can cause an irregular
pattern in the daily reported figures. The Times is excluding these
anomalies from seven-day averages when possible.

Experts'
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-profile-covid.html}{understanding
of how the Covid-19 works is growing}. It seems that there are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html}{four
factors that most likely play a role}: how close you get to an infected
person; how long you are near that person; whether that person expels
viral droplets on or near you; and how much you touch your face
afterwards.

You can help reduce your risk and do your part to protect others by
following some
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/prepare-for-coronavirus.html}{basic
steps}:

Keep your distance from others. Stay at least six feet away from people
outside your household as much as possible.

Wear a mask outside your home. A mask protects others from your germs,
and it protects you from infection as well. The more people who wear
masks, the more we all stay safer.

Wash your hands often. Anytime you come in contact with a surface
outside your home, scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds, rinse and
then dry your hands with a clean towel.

Avoid touching your face. The virus can spread when our hands come into
contact with the virus, and we touch our nose, mouth or eyes. Try to
keep your hands away from your face unless you have just recently washed
them.

Here's a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html}{complete
guide on how you can prepare} for the coronavirus outbreak.
