\subparagraph{Numbers to watch for when results come
in}\label{numbers-to-watch-for-when-results-come-in}}

South Carolina polls close at 7 p.m. and usually they report their
results quite quickly. In the 2016 Democratic primary, 86 percent of the
vote was counted by 9 p.m.

In the event of an early call, here are two numbers to keep in mind:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{30}The delegate margin Mr. Biden needs to take the delegate
  lead over Bernie Sanders.
\item
  \textbf{86,049}The margin of victory in the statewide popular vote
  that Mr. Biden would need to take the lead in the cumulative popular
  vote over Mr. Sanders.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{south-carolina-political-geography}{%
\subparagraph{South Carolina political
geography}\label{south-carolina-political-geography}}

Mr. Biden is considered the favorite because of his strength among black
voters, who represent a majority of Democratic voters in the state. On
average, Mr. Biden leads by 15 points in the most recent polls, and he
could win by much more than that in rural, midland and low country
counties where nearly all Democratic voters are African-American.

Mr. Sanders might fare better in areas where white voters make up a
larger share of the electorate, like the populous but Republican
upcountry Piedmont region, or even along the coast in a competitive
race.

\hypertarget{where-votes-remain-for-each-candidate}{%
\subsection{Where Votes Remain for Each
Candidate}\label{where-votes-remain-for-each-candidate}}

For places that have not yet reported all their votes, we make an
educated guess based on the results so far and what we know about the
people who live in those places.

Count}\label{estimate-of-the-pledged-delegate-count}}

There are 54 pledged delegates at stake; 19 delegates are allocated
based on the statewide vote, and 35 are divided between the state's
seven congressional districts. Candidates must receive 15 percent of the
vote statewide or in a congressional district to receive delegates.
