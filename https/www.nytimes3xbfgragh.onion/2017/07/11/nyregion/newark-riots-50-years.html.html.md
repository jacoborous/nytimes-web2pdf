NEWARK — The fuse that ignited this city — violent clashes with the
police, gunfire, flames from burning buildings — was a rumor. Word
spread that a black cabdriver had been killed inside a police precinct
house. It was not true — the driver had been arrested and injured.

Still, it was enough to inflame a population filled with years of
pent-up grievances: not only abuse at the hands of the police, but
entrenched, unaddressed poverty, urban renewal policies that bypassed
black residents and a white political power structure that had long
ignored their needs.

The unrest, which started on the night of July 12, 1967, and ended on
July 17, came during a period when racial tensions were exploding into
violent conflagrations across the country: the Watts neighborhood in Los
Angeles, Harlem, Detroit and nearby New Jersey communities, including
Plainfield.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Amid all that, what made Newark’s unrest striking was the physical toll,
placing it among the deadliest of the riots. Over several days, 26
people were killed — many of them black residents, as well as a white
firefighter and a white police detective — and more than 700 were
injured. The riots caused about $10 million in damages and reduced
entire blocks to charred ruins, some of which remain vacant
grass-covered lots.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The turbulence also left an enduring legacy in molding perceptions of
the city, even though those impressions vary widely. To some, the flames
and violence were riots, wrecking neighborhoods and driving away white
and middle-class residents, feeding a notion that Newark was a dangerous
and broken place. Or it was a rebellion, the uprising of a
long-oppressed community that had finally had enough, and from that, a
new sense of empowerment was
born.

## A City Pushed to the Edge

On July 12, 1967, residents of a large public housing development saw
the black cabdriver badly beaten by police officers and followed them to
the Fourth Police Precinct house, in Newark’s Central Ward. The crowd
ignored calls for a peaceful protest, and the police responded in force.

### Junius W. Williams

*He was a law student at the time and has long been a civil rights
activist in Newark. He is now director of the Abbott Leadership
Institute at Rutgers University, Newark.*

It was very tense in Newark before this happened, and it was all based
on race and class, but race predominated because all of this was
happening at the expense of and to black people, no matter if you were
poor, middle-class or working. The police were agents of oppression and
the political system was hellbent on keeping us in our place.

The first two or three days there was a sense that this was the relief
and the release that people needed. But in the second three days, once
the combined police force — local, state
and<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>the National Guard — had
been fully deployed, there was fear, because the police rioted. If this
was a rebellion, the police rioted. They took it in their own hands to
seek retribution against people for the slightest infraction.

### Paul Zigo

*He served as a member of the New Jersey National Guard and deployed to
the Central Ward of Newark on July 14, 1967, his 25th birthday. He
recently retired as a professor of American history at Brookdale
Community College and is the director of the World War II Era Studies
Institute. *

There was nothing but a huge red glow over the entire city. The city was
in flames. You immediately took note of what you may be entering into —
and that was a war zone. Buildings were smashed, windows were broken all
over the place. You saw a very angry crowd, and when they saw you, they
started coming in and around your Jeep.

I saw two black men fighting like hell among themselves, and what I did
was pull my pistol and fire two shots into the air. \[He told the men to
leave.\] They stopped fighting and they scampered down the street. But
to my surprise, when I did that, someone within a blacked-out church —
St. Rose of Lima Church off Orange Street — took aim at me and fired at
me. The bullets came toward me and went over my head by about a foot. I
didn’t know I was being fired at. Someone called out, “Don’t you know
you’re being fired at?” If it weren’t for that individual, who I
considered an angel, I wouldn’t have taken
cover.

### “We took pride in our police-community relations program. This night has destroyed what we thought was a good relationship. We can’t sweep this under a rug. Time is running out. It has gotten to the point where you can’t take it any longer.”

Albert Black

Chairman of Newark’s Human Rights Commission, quoted by The New York
Times in a 1967 article about a meeting with Mayor Hugh J. Addonizio on
the second day of unrest, in which black leaders
expressed<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>frustration with the
police over racism and brutality.

I was a 13-year-old paperboy for The Newark Star-Ledger in the Vailsburg
section of Newark. I saw military vehicles with soldiers riding up and
down South Orange Avenue. Some of the paperboys were sent out of town to
stay with relatives to the dismay of our manager, Mr. Lamb. I carried a
book of poems by Amiri Baraka on my route, hoping I would be seen as an
ally if I ran into any rioters. The father of a friend from the
neighborhood was a fireman. He was shot and killed by a sniper — firemen
rode on the outside of the truck, clinging to the railing back then.
Mayor Hugh Addonizio was one of my customers. I delivered my papers
every morning unharmed, collected from my customers that Friday and
Saturday, and paid my bill to Mr. Lamb on Saturday
afternoon.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span>

What is your most vivid memory from the riots?

Following the National Guard convoys out of the city at night after my
shift as a copy editor ended at The Newark News. I was concerned at the
time that my Army Reserve unit may be activated for riot duty.
Thankfully, we were not. We lacked even rudimentary training and would
have been as ineffective and insensitive as many of the guardsmen and
state troopers on the scene. Working through the riots was both
frightening and surreal.

But the editors failed in the years leading up to the riots to examine
or expose the root causes of the unrest. Very little original reporting
was done in the black community, while downtown business interests and
the suburbs were lavishly covered. When the city exploded, The News
lacked black reporters with deep ties to the community to adequately
explain the ferment.

### Ruth Dolinko

*Ms. Dolinko’s husband, Morris,* ****** *who died in 2010, ran a
delicatessen supply business with his father and two other partners. It
is now run by her son and another partner. Ms. Dolinko and her husband
were both born and raised in Newark, and moved to West Orange in 1956.
The business was not damaged in the unrest because, she said, black
employees had stationed themselves outside and encouraged rioters to
spare
it.*

The people were very distressed. The way the black community was treated

It was chaotic, to say the least. We were not prepared. We had no

in their own shotguns.

To see the devastation that was taking place over the next few days —
the burning, the looting, the breaking into stores. It was devastating
for those of us who love this city, who live in this city. The fear I
had wasn't for my own safety, but for watching the city I loved go up in
flames. You begin to realize this is going to take a really long time to
recover
from.

### “The people in Newark have to choose sides. They are either citizens of America or criminals who would shoot down a fire captain in the back and then depend on people to speak in platitudes about police brutality.”

Gov. RICHARD J. HUGHES

New Jersey’s governor from 1962 to 1970, speaking at a news conference
as the unrest entered its fifth day.

-----

## ‘Newark Became a Fearful Place’

White residents started leaving Newark well before the riots, drawn by
the advent of suburbs and the highway system. But researchers said the
unrest propelled the exodus and gave the city a dismal reputation. For
those who remained, especially African-Americans, the healing process
has been slow and difficult.

### Mr. Ricciardi

Before the riots, our neighborhood was filled with cops, firemen,
construction workers and teachers. They moved because things were
expected to get worse (home values, safety). We did not have the
financial option to move — my father was a disabled police officer and
my mother worked nights at a hospital in East Orange to support her five
children. Newark became a fearful place — above-ground walkways to the
Gateway buildings from Penn Station. No one wanted to set foot in
Newark.

Whatever trust and friendliness existed between blacks and whites eroded
after the riots. White flight accelerated; the streets that were busy in
the downtown area emptied out after 5 p.m., and many businesses closed.
While I haven't lived in Newark for many years, I follow its ups and
(mostly) downs, wondering when it will experience a rebirth much like
Jersey City and Hoboken. It's a shame. My life in Newark was the source

In the aftermath — the State Police did their thing and left, and we

wore blue. We had to repair some of the damage done by other folks. 

Our relationship wasn’t great to begin with. You could cut the tension
with a knife. I remember being on patrol. It took a long time to develop
some trust again. That took long, hard
work.

## An Empowered Community

One of the sources of frustration was a plan to build a medical school
in the Central Ward, which would have occupied more than 150 acres and
displaced thousands of residents, most of them black or Hispanic. After
the unrest, Mr. Williams, the civil rights activist, argued that black
residents were in a position to push back, reducing the school’s
footprint and encouraging it to serve the surrounding community.

### Mr. Williams

As the smoke cleared and the last dying embers of the flames receded,
some of us realized the power structure was afraid. First time they had
ever been afraid of us in this city. So we began to think of, how are we
are going to take advantage of this violence that nobody wanted? My
group was formed, the Newark Area Planning Association, and we decided
we were going to work on the medical school. We had to cut that medical
school down. Some people didn’t want it at all, but some of us saw it as
something valuable.

The black community was definitely empowered. Nobody wanted that
violence. But at the same time, people were politically adept enough to
see that we had the opportunity to turn that destructive power into
something that was positive for the community, which if they had just
allowed us to do in the beginning, it never would have happened.

### Mr. Zigo

As I toured Newark after arriving, seeing the devastation I saw, plus
the conditions under which many, many people were living in the Central
Ward, you could understand why there was an angriness, why there was,
you could say, a rebellion. It was pure, pure impoverishment. The lack
of attention, you could see it. Go back to Newark now, it’s all
different. What an improvement. A positive result did come about because
of the riots, but it took years.

### Mildred C. Crump

*Ms. Crump, the president of the Newark City Council, was the first
African-American woman elected to the council, in 1994. She moved to
Newark from Detroit in 1965, and worked for more than 40 years as a
Braille teacher at the New Jersey Commission for the Blind and Visually
Impaired.*

There has been significant progress, but not enough, trust me. But
there's been progress for African-Americans. Now we’re a black and brown
community. Our Hispanic brothers and sisters were part of the
progression that we made. For example, my husband and I bought a house
in the South Ward where the Jewish community was in prominence. That
could never have happened if 1967 had not
happened.

## Enduring Problems

Last year, the city reached a settlement with the United States Justice
Department that led to the appointment of a federal monitor and the
implementation of sweeping reforms, including establishing a civilian
oversight committee. A three-year investigation highlighted issues
similar to those that fueled the riots: Three-fourths of pedestrian
stops cited by the police were not justified, minorities were stopped
more often than whites and the use of force was underreported.

### Ryan P. Haygood

*Mr. Haygood, a civil rights lawyer, is the president and chief
executive of the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice.*

The consent decree is such an important document. It’s a 70-page
document with more than 100 provisions that contemplate widespread
reform in almost every area of policing — in the way officers are
trained, in the way officers are disciplined, in the way officers
collect and store evidence.

Look at the strides the city has made in 50 years, but there’s also a
need to look at the underlying issues that led to the Newark rebellion
in the first place. If we fail to address those issues, we leave
ourselves vulnerable to another rebellion.

### Derek Glenn

*Mr. Glenn is a Newark police captain and a spokesman for the
department.*

One of the most important lessons that came out of those challenging
days is that the racial composition of the Newark Police Division more
closely reflects the demographics of our residents. Today, we have a
police division comprising 42 percent Hispanic, 37 percent black and the
remaining representing whites, Asians and others. And I’m very proud of
these numbers because I know that the people of the city of Newark
deserve a police division that they can relate to. The us-against-them
mentality is markedly reduced when police reflect the community. This
didn’t exist in 1967, when only 11 percent of Newark police officers
were black in contrast to 50 percent of the city’s residents’ being
black at that
time.

Has it recovered? Not completely. There are still some emotional trauma
and other things we haven’t recovered from and social conditions that
led to the rebellion itself. And it hasn’t been fully addressed. Some of
the physical and economical circumstances, while they’re not exactly the
same as it was, there are vestiges of it and we’ve been moving very
rapidly to eliminate all of it.

Obviously, some things that exist now didn’t exist then that played into
why something like that would not happen again. We don’t have a
predominantly white Police Department anymore. You have a predominantly
black and brown Police Department — in leadership positions. You still
have issues. But some of those officers come from the city of Newark.
Their families are here. Those are the things that changed.

There’s the social sector of the community that is basically controlled
by black and brown people, so that kind of helps mitigate the
conditions. But the underlying circumstances that create poverty and
homelessness have not completely gone or been addressed adequately.
That’s our job to try to get that done.

Even though we’re having all these programs to talk about the 50-year
anniversary of this rebellion, there hasn’t been any real conversation
in New Jersey. Most of those folks have left the city. There has been no
conversation with those in the suburbs and those in the city to talk
about what caused \[the riots\], which I think would lead to a deeper
discussion about equality in America.

### Mr. Lazarus

I grew up in Newark when it was a thriving commercial and manufacturing
hub, a city of vast parks, strong schools, wonderful branch libraries
and viable neighborhoods, all except the Central Ward, the deliberately
overlooked ground-zero ghetto. This all went away with the riots. My
family moved to the suburbs in 1957, so we escaped the immediacy of the
destruction, but felt its impact for a lifetime.

I worked nights in Newark for the remainder of my news career and saw
the scarring effects of those four nights of hell linger for decades.
But Newark has definitely managed to turn a corner. Development, jobs
and commerce are improving. The city has become a higher education
center. Political leadership, while imperfect, is superior to previous
iterations, both black and white. And, after a 40-year absence, the city
ended its food-desert reputation by enticing supermarkets to come
in.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span>

I really like the diversity of Newark, and the fact that, even though
it's a very large city — the largest city in New Jersey — it feels like
a small town. When you walk around here, I'll bump into 10 people I know
anytime I walk outside. Each of the wards has a different feel, a
different flavor.

Even though there is skepticism from a great deal of people who have
been hurt before, I think there is also this competing hope, where
people are hopeful that maybe this time, with the vibrancy and
intergenerational nature with a lot of these coalitions, we can get some
reforms going. ​

### Sheriff Fontoura

I'm sick and tired of talking about the riots. It was 50 years ago. The
day we stop talking about the riots, that's the day we make a full
comeback.

## How The Times covered the riots in 1967

### [Day 1](https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1967/07/13/90372463.html?pageNumber=1)

> The violence was believed to have started after the arrest of a Negro
> cabdriver on charges of assaulting a policeman. The crowd of Negroes
> that gathered outside the Fourth Precinct station house protested the
> arrest and some persons shouted “police brutality\!”
> 
> The mob that gathered around the station house threw rocks and
> bottles. At least five policemen were struck by stones, one policeman
> reported.

### [Day 2](https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1967/07/14/83616047.html?pageNumber=1)

> Mayor Hugh J. Addonizio telephoned Gov. Richard J. Hughes at 2:20 a.m.
> and told the governor that the rampaging Negroes who had looted,
> burned and smashed their way through the city in the second straight
> night of violence had produced an “ominous
situation.”

### [Day 3](https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1967/07/15/83616900.html?pageNumber=1)

> Gov. Richard J. Hughes declared Newark a city in “criminal
> insurrection” as the fighting and looting continued despite a curfew
> and the presence of armed troops. The violence was the nation’s worst
> racial outbreak since the rioting in the Watts section of Los Angeles
> in
1965.

### [Day 4](https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1967/07/16/83617964.html?pageNumber=1)

> The governor, red with anger, said shortly before midnight that it was
> time that the people of Newark chose between the terrorists and law
> and order.
> 
> “This is a criminal insurrection by people who say they hate the white
> man but who really hate America,” Governor Hughes
charged. 

### [Day 5](https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1967/07/17/90374734.html?pageNumber=1)

> Nearly half of Newark’s 23.7 square miles was an occupied zone. As
> sporadic sniping continued, guardsmen and policemen — weary and
> trigger-quick after days and nights of tension — were reported to have
> engaged each other in several accidental
gunfights.

### [Day 6](https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1967/07/18/90375517.html?pageNumber=1)

> Although the city appeared to be returning to normal, there was yet
> another fatal incident early today. A Negro was shot and killed by the
> police in the Negro section while allegedly attempting to loot a
> store. His death was the 26th since the rioting began Wednesday.
