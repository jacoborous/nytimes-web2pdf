  You can't rush a vaccine. Hi guys. I'm Jeneen Interlandi. I am back in
  New York City. And I'm here to give you an update on the coronavirus
  pandemic. So here's where we're at this week, we are getting close to
  the 5 million mark on national case count, and we have almost 160,000
  coronavirus deaths. The daily average of new cases is actually down
  from just two weeks ago. But the daily death toll is still quite high.
  And we have to keep in mind that the virus is still spreading
  uncontrolled through too many parts of the country. But there's still
  some cause for hope. ``We hope that as the time we get into the late
  fall and early winter, we will have, in fact, a vaccine that we can
  say would be safe and effective.'' A couple months ago, I was actually
  not that optimistic about the prospects for a coronavirus vaccine this
  year. But now I'm actually inclined to agree with Dr. Fauci. No. 1,
  there's so many candidates moving through the pipeline. No. 2, several
  of those candidates are already in late-stage clinical trials. And No.
  3, there's already production facilities being planned for and built
  so that if one of these vaccines does prove safe and effective, we'll
  be able to manufacture it very quickly. This is really actually quite
  extraordinary, right? If we get a vaccine within the next several
  months. It's going to be one of the fastest vaccine development
  projects like in human history if not the fastest. It normally takes a
  long, long time to develop a vaccine. We test it in a small batch of
  humans, then a larger group of humans and then an even larger group of
  humans. So some people have begun to suggest that we should
  potentially perhaps skip these Phase 3 trials and just make the
  vaccine available to anybody who wants it right now, you know, while
  the Phase 3 trials are being done in the background. That's a terrible
  idea. We cannot skip Phase 3 trials. Phase 3 is especially important
  for detecting, like, rare side effects. Right? So if it's very rare,
  it's only going to show up in a small portion of the population. That
  means you have to test a lot of people to detect it. And then the
  other problem is vaccine hesitancy, which is if you start skipping
  steps now, when you do have something that works and you try to get
  people to take it, you're increasing the likelihood that people are
  not going to trust it later on. And that's a problem. While I do feel
  optimistic about a vaccine, and that's certainly a bright spot,
  everything else is still pretty grim. A thousand people or so are
  dying every single day in this country. We're still not doing all of
  the things that we can and should be doing to stop that from
  happening, to stop the virus from spreading and to get it under
  control. Sorry to end on a depressing note, guys. But that's where
  things are. In the meantime, mask up, stay safe.
