  ``Yes.'' Reporter: ``Kayleigh, if the president is so worried about
  how long it will take to count ballots in the election, then why isn't
  the president and this White House doing everything it can to secure
  more funding for staffing and other resources to make sure that we can
  have a safe and proper election?'' ``Look, what this White House is
  focused on is making sure that our election is not riddled with voting
  fraud, and that the timetable is not hung up here. We are --- there
  are several lawsuits that the campaign is engaged on. And I would
  point you to the campaign for specifics.'' Reporter: ``That doesn't
  answer my question, though. My question is, what is the White House
  doing to get more resources for funding and staff to make sure, as the
  president says, that it will be a secure and safe election?'' ``Well
  as you know, Peter, states run their elections and it is up to states
  ---'' Reporter: ``And they're asking for more money.'' ``But what this
  White House is focused on is ensuring that --- what Jeffrey Toobin has
  said over at The New Yorker, CNN contributor notably, `New York's
  primary vote count chaos signals trouble for November.' And as he
  noted, you want to talk about the president, but Jeffrey Toobin
  himself: Democrats controlled the state government of New York. They
  are responsible for creating the fiasco that is unfolding now. And
  that is certain to get worse in November. States need to get their
  acts together when it comes to elections. And as we see in New York,
  where we're five weeks out from that election. And in fact, we still
  don't know the outcome of a congressional race, and that is certainly
  not what we want to see.'' Reporter: ``I'm asking you about the
  president.''
