  ``No show gets a free ride because you had a success before. You're as
  naked as you were the first day you worked, and you better make it
  good.'' For more than half a century, Harold Prince produced or
  directed many of the most successful and influential musicals on
  Broadway. {[}singing{]} ``The Pajama Game.'' {[}singing{]} ``West Side
  Story.'' {[}singing{]} {[}singing{]} ``Fiddler on the Roof.''
  {[}singing{]} And ``Phantom of the Opera,'' the longest-running show
  in Broadway history. {[}singing{]} {[}singing{]} Prince, perhaps more
  than anyone else, trailblazed a new direction for the modern musical.
  We sat down with this Broadway titan in September 2008, to discuss his
  career and the astounding 21 Tony awards he has won, more Tonys than
  anyone else. ``It's a nice thing to get them, but they are not a
  measure. `West Side Story.' That never got a Tony. That was
  history-making, but not celebrated at its time. History is littered
  with great works of art that got terrible reviews originally. And they
  survived.'' Harold Prince was born in 1928 and raised in New York City
  during the Great Depression. As a young boy, his family often took him
  to the theater, where he loved to escape. ``I was a very solitary kid.
  I had a theater made of cardboard, and I would listen to the opera on
  Saturdays and Milton Cross would tell the story of the opera.''
  Announcer: ``The opera house is in complete darkness for this opening
  storm-raging scene.'' ``And I would move little tin people around on
  the stage. It was my solitary, imaginative world. The world that I
  conjured up in my head was much more real than the world outside.''
  But the hardships of the Great Depression took its toll on Prince. And
  at the age of 14, he had what he says was a nervous breakdown. ``I
  wandered the street having kind of conversations in my head. I came to
  my parents and said, I think there's something really wrong. It's just
  a black cloud over everything. And within a space of about three
  months, it began to go away. The legacy of it was that I came out of
  it a different person --- extremely ambitious. I wanted what I wanted,
  and I was going to get it.'' He graduated from the University of
  Pennsylvania in 1948. ``I came back to New York. And then I thought,
  what am I going to do?'' What he did was write a letter to George
  Abbott, Broadway's most important producer and director at the time,
  asking for a job. ``I said, I would like to work for you. I live with
  my parents and the subway's a nickel. I can afford to work for six
  months for nothing. And here was the clincher --- if you can tell that
  you're not paying me, then fire me, please. It's a very intriguing
  thing.'' Abbott took Prince under his wing, employing him primarily as
  an assistant stage manager. By 1954, after a two-year stint in the
  Army, an opportunity came his way --- a book about a strike in a
  pajama factory, courtesy of his friend and future producing partner,
  Robert Griffith. ``Bobby Griffith called me one day and said, there's
  a book review in The Times. It seems like a musical. I called around
  to find the agent. He said, you know I've had another offer. Leland
  Hayward has made an offer. And I think there will be other offers.
  What can you guys give me that would persuade me? We said, well, if we
  could talk George Abbott into directing it, would that interest you?
  He said, if you can talk George Abbott into directing it, the book is
  yours.'' {[}singing{]} Reporter: ``This was your first show and you
  had a hit.'' ``Huge hit. Huge hit. On the opening night at the St.
  James Theater, Bobby Griffith and I were on either side of the stage.
  And when the show was over, we simply walked across the stage and
  embraced each other. It was a giant smash, long lines the next day,
  and so on.'' Directed by Abbott and Jerome Robbins, and choreographed
  by Bob Fosse, ``The Pajama Game'' won the Tony award for best musical.
  ``It's often very hard to follow a hit with another hit. There's a
  sophomore jinx, but you did.'' ``Yeah. Well, George Abbott found a
  book called `The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant.' He said, I think
  it'd make a good musical. Want to do it? A year later, we opened. It
  was a hit.'' {[}singing{]} ``Damn Yankees,'' a tale of a man who sells
  his soul to the devil to help the Washington Senators win the pennant.
  It was directed by Abbott, and again, choreographed by Fosse.
  {[}singing{]} Then came a landmark in Prince's career. Stephen
  Sondheim had become a good friend. But in the mid-1950s, Prince had
  become a Broadway success, and Sondheim was still hoping for his first
  Broadway credit. ``He was working on what became `West Side Story.' He
  was Lenny Bernstein's lyricist.'' The show lost its producer while in
  development and was without financing. Prince told Sondheim that he
  and Robert Griffith were interested in producing it. ``I said, could
  you put together the authors? And we would hear the score. Steve had
  been told by Lenny never to play the score for anyone. So I went to
  Bernstein's apartment and Lenny played the score. And I started to hum
  along the score, and he stopped halfway through it and said, that's
  what I've always wanted: A musical producer who really understands
  music. And I never did tell him that I'd heard the score dozens of
  times.'' {[}singing{]} {[}singing{]} ``We loved it and turned to them
  and said, we'll do it. But we have to raise the money very quickly. We
  had such a successful track record that, I'd say, we're doing a
  musical. Please tell us within the next 24 hours whether you want in.
  And within 24 hours, everyone was in. And we had it.'' {[}singing{]}
  ``West Side Story'' made its debut on Broadway in 1957. ``It was not
  as big a hit as the first two. That I would stand at the back of the
  theater and I thought, you're backstage at theater history. And by
  God, you're a small part of it.'' {[}singing{]} In 1961, Prince
  suffered a major shock when his producing partner, Robert Griffith,
  died suddenly. ``Bobby was playing golf and had a heart attack and
  died the next day. I was at the hospital. And I mean, what could be
  more shocking? He was in his 50s. And I thought, you know, it's sort
  of the end of the world. I really relied on him enormously.'' Prince
  had already been thinking about doing more than producing hits and the
  loss of his producing partner spurred him on. ``What I really wanted
  to do was that cliché. What I really want to be is a director.'' His
  first notable hit was ``She Loves Me'' in 1963. {[}singing{]} Then in
  1966, came his groundbreaking musical, ``Cabaret,'' based on
  Christopher Isherwood's ``Berlin Stories,'' and with a score by John
  Kander and Fred Ebb. {[}singing{]} ``I've always thought the two years
  in Uncle Sam's army provided a deductible. I used to hang out in
  Stuttgart in a cheesy, bombed-out church cellar where there was an
  M.C. --- you can see what's coming --- and three bovine chorus women.
  And I just loved it. I sat at the bar for hours and hours and this
  little guy, painted with lipstick and false eyelashes, who was about
  as funny as the entertainer, but tragic and wonderful. And I came back
  with him all those years later and I said, we should create a role for
  the M.C.. He is the entertainer, but we should make him metaphorical.
  He should represent Berlin and the depths of the Depression --- eager
  to please, hopeless, bad taste, energetic. And as the evening goes on,
  he should turn into the Nazis. So that by the time the evening is
  over, he's pulled Germany out, but he's consummate evil.''
  {[}singing{]} ``Cabaret'' was a revelation. It moved the musical away
  from straightforward storytelling and into a fragmented narrative
  form, one that would influence much that came after it, including such
  landmark musicals as ``A Chorus Line'' in Chicago. ``You have to
  express yourself, not the status quo, by being more daring, by really
  expressing who you are, and by making the musicals what you think
  musicals should be.'' ``Cabaret'' established Prince as a director.
  And then he reunited with Sondheim and they created show after show.
  ``Company,'' with its non-linear libretto about a man of 35 afraid to
  commit to a relationship. ``Follies,'' about a reunion of chorus girls
  in a ruined theater 30 years after their youthful success. ``A Little
  Night Music,'' based on a movie by Ingmar Bergman. And ``Sweeney Todd:
  The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.'' {[}singing{]} ``Directing, I had
  to hopefully find something of myself. It was a lot easier when you're
  working with Steve Sondheim, let me tell you, because he was of the
  same mind. And he was courageous as hell.'' More hits came in the late
  1970s and the 1980s. Prince and Andrew Lloyd Webber teamed up to make
  ``Evita'' and ``Phantom of the Opera.'' ``He said, I'm thinking of a
  musical idea. Do you think there's anything in `Phantom of the Opera?'
  And I said, I'll do it. And he said, why do you want to do it so much?
  I said, because it's romantic. Let's do a Victorian romance, larger
  than life. Let's take the theater and turn it into another world, and
  have the audience come in from the street and just enter that world,
  like so many children. Put a mantel of romance over them.''
  {[}singing{]} ``The very thing that brought me into the theater in the
  first place: escape.'' {[}singing{]} Prince's own imagination
  continued to challenge theatergoers. ``I'm trying desperately not to
  be the old director who tells anecdotes to the company, instead of
  directs the play. I live for the next musical. I live in the future.
  I'm totally mindful that nobody will ever have the life I've had in
  the theater. That's past. And that's damn sad.''
