WASHINGTON --- President Trump pledged close security and economic
cooperation with Japan on Friday, opening an elaborate multiday
work-and-play visit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that is intended to
showcase a warm rapport with a central player in Asia.

Hoping to put behind any friction remaining from his sometimes
provocative statements during last year's presidential campaign, Mr.
Trump hugged Mr. Abe as he arrived at the White House, lavished praise
on him and his nation, and offered strong reassurances about America's
commitment to Japan's defense.

``The bond between our two nations and the friendship between our two
peoples runs very, very deep,'' Mr. Trump said at a news conference with
Mr. Abe, reading from a prepared text. ``This administration is
committed to bringing those ties even closer. We are committed to the
security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control and to
further strengthening our very crucial alliance.''

Speaking without notes later in the news conference, Mr. Trump said he
had hit it off with Mr. Abe personally. ``We have a very, very good bond
--- very, very good chemistry,'' he said. ``I'll let you know if it
changes, but I don't think it will.''

The visit, Mr. Trump's second with a head of government since being
sworn in last month, was an opportunity for the president to highlight a
positive dynamic with a leader with whom he had already developed a
relationship. But it could prove awkward, after
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/asia/donald-trump-china-xi-jinping-letter.html}{a
show of détente} on Thursday night between Mr. Trump and President Xi
Jinping of China.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/asia/trump-abe-meeting-japan-trade-defense.html}{Among
the topics of discussion} during Mr. Abe's weekend visit will be
whether, and how, to pursue a bilateral trade agreement between the
United States and Japan after Mr. Trump's decision to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/tpp-trump-trade-nafta.html}{withdraw
from the Trans-Pacific Partnership}, a sweeping trade deal between the
United States and 11 nations that included Japan.

Mr. Trump also tried to dispel
\href{http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/08/06/national/politics-diplomacy/trump-rips-u-s-defense-japan-one-sided-expensive/}{doubts
about his commitment} to a mutual defense treaty with Japan that
surfaced during his campaign, when he said he was prepared to pull back
from the pact unless Tokyo did more to reimburse the United States for
defending Japanese territory.

Mr. Trump reaffirmed his support for the treaty on Friday,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/world/asia/us-japan-mattis-abe-defense.html}{as
his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, did} during a visit to Tokyo last
week. And with his reference to ``areas under its administrative
control,'' Mr. Trump made clear that the treaty extended to disputed
islands in the East China Sea, known in Japan as the Senkaku and in
China as the Diaoyu.

Mr. Abe responded with equal warmth, congratulating Mr. Trump on his
inauguration and welcoming his commitment to the defense treaty while
sidestepping questions about Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the
Trans-Pacific Partnership. ``With the birth of the Trump administration,
a new genesis will be built between Japan and the U.S. in economic
relations,'' he said.

Acutely aware of Mr. Trump's complaints about foreign competitors, Mr.
Abe stressed that ``Japanese businesses have built factories all over
the United States'' and invested \$150 billion, creating many American
jobs. ``Japan, with our high level of technical capability, we will be
able to contribute to President Trump's growth strategy,'' he said.
``There will be even more new jobs being born in the United States.''

He specifically cited Japan's bullet-train technology, noting that if it
existed along America's Eastern corridor, it would take ``only one
hour'' for the president to travel from the White House in Washington to
Trump Tower in New York.

While he stuck to positive themes during their public comments, Mr. Abe
may have questions in private for Mr. Trump about his provocative
statements related to Japan, including his warning to Toyota on Twitter
that he would slap a ``big border tax'' on the carmaker if it built a
new plant in Mexico and his charges that Japan devalues its currency to
gain economic advantage.

Mr. Abe was the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/world/asia/shinzo-abe-donald-trump.html}{first
foreign leader to visit Mr. Trump} after his election in November, and
they have spoken a number of times since then, according to the
officials.

By contrast, the president has gotten off to a chilly start with Mr. Xi,
who was angered by Mr. Trump's decision in November to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/world/asia/china-donald-trump-taiwan-twitter.html}{take
a congratulatory call from the president of Taiwan} --- which China
considers a breakaway province --- and his subsequent questioning of the
``One China'' policy. Mr. Trump had a fence-mending call with Mr. Xi on
Thursday night and agreed to honor the One China policy at the Chinese
leader's request.

``We had a very, very good talk last night and discussed a lot of
subjects,'' Mr. Trump said. He predicted that he would get along with
China and forge a fairer playing field on trade and currency. ``I
believe that will all work out very well for everybody, China, Japan,
the United States and everybody in the region,'' he said.

Even so, Mr. Abe's visit could fuel suspicions in Beijing that Mr. Trump
intends to make Japan, rather than China, the focal point of his
engagement with Asia. That would be a distinct shift from former
President Barack Obama, who hosted Mr. Xi in 2013 for an informal summit
meeting at the
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/us/politics/an-expansive-setting-for-obamas-talks-with-chinas-leader.html}{200-acre
Sunnylands estate} in Rancho Mirage, Calif.

Mr. Trump's extended meeting with Mr. Abe, combining business and
pleasure, follows a first few weeks in office for Mr. Trump that have
been marked by tense exchanges with longstanding United States allies
like
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/world/americas/mexico-pena-nieto-donald-trump.html}{Mexico},
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/world/australia/donald-trump-malcolm-turnbull-refugees.html}{Australia}
and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/world/europe/germany-prepares-for-turbulence-in-the-trump-era.html}{Germany}.

After a working lunch at the White House on Friday, the two leaders
planned to board Air Force One and fly to Palm Beach, Fla., where they
were to head to Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's club, for dinner with their
wives and a weekend of relaxation. They will spend Saturday playing golf
together.

A White House official said Mr. Trump was paying for Mr. Abe and his
wife to travel to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend, as a ``gift'' to the
leader. That eliminates potential ethics questions the visit would
otherwise pose for Mr. Trump, who has
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trump-organization-business-conflicts.html}{pledged}
to contribute to the United States Treasury any profits from foreign
visitors to his company's properties.
