Patients in a clinical trial will receive a placebo or remdesivir, which
has shown promise in laboratory studies.

China is forging ahead in the search for
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/technology/coronavirus-treatment-benevolentai-baricitinib.html}{treatments}
for people sickened by the new
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/health/coronavirus-antiviral-drugs.html}{coronavirus}
that has infected more than 28,000 people in a countrywide epidemic,
killed more than 500 and seeded smaller outbreaks in 24 other nations.

The need is urgent: There are no approved treatments for illnesses
caused by coronaviruses.

On Thursday, China began enrolling patients in a clinical trial of
remdesivir, an antiviral medicine made by Gilead, the American
pharmaceutical giant.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/health/coronavirus-antiviral-drugs.html}{drug}
has to be given intravenously, is experimental and not yet approved for
any use, and has not been studied in patients with any coronavirus
disease. But studies of infected mice and monkeys have suggested that
remdesivir can fight coronaviruses.

And it appears to be safe. It was tested without ill effects in Ebola
patients, although it did not work well against that virus, which is in
a different family from coronaviruses.

Doctors in Washington State gave remdesivir to
the\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/us/corona-virus-washington-state.html}{first
coronavirus patient} in the United States last week after his condition
worsened and pneumonia developed when he'd been in the hospital for a
week. His symptoms improved the next day.

A single case cannot determine whether a drug works, but a
report\href{https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191}{on the
Washington patient}, in The New England Journal of Medicine, has
nonetheless sparked excitement about the drug.

Another \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0}{report
published on Tuesday} by scientists in China added to the enthusiasm,
showing that remdesivir blocked the new coronavirus, officially known as
2019-nCoV, from infecting cells grown in the lab.

``It is important to keep in mind that this is an experimental medicine
that has only been used in a small number of patients with 2019-nCoV to
date, so we do not have an appropriately robust understanding of the
effect of this drug to warrant broad use at this time,'' Ryan McKeel, a
Gilead spokesman, said in an email.

Two clinical trials will take place in Wuhan, China, the center of the
outbreak; 500 patients will receive the drug, and comparison groups will
get a placebo, Mr. McKeel said.

\href{https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04257656}{One trial, which
began enrolling patients} on Thursday, includes people who are severely
ill with symptoms such as needing oxygen. The other trial will
involve\href{https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04252664?term=remdesivir\&draw=2\&rank=1}{patients
who are hospitalized but not as sick}.

The patients will be given the drug intravenously for 10 days, and then
assessed 28 days after the treatment to see how they fared compared to
the placebo groups.

If the drug works, will Gilead be able to provide enough for everyone
who needs it?

``There are currently limited available clinical supplies of remdesivir,
but we are working to increase our available supply as rapidly as
possible,'' Mr. McKeel said.

    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

Gilead had stockpiled the drug, as well as the materials used to make
it, for use against Ebola. The company is now using that stockpile for
the trials in China and for individual patients like the one in
Washington State, whose doctors sought special permission from the Food
and Drug Administration for ``compassionate use'' so that they could
give him an unapproved drug.

The company plans to speed production and is looking for ``manufacturing
partners in multiple geographies,'' Mr. McKeel said, adding that Gilead
was going ahead with these preparations without knowing yet whether the
drug works against the new coronavirus.

In the meantime, the Wuhan Institute of Virology has applied for a
patent in China to use remdesivir to treat the coronavirus, according to
a
\href{http://www.whiov.ac.cn/kyjz_105338/202002/t20200204_5497136.html?from=groupmessage}{statement
on the institute's website}.

Gilead already has patents for the drug in China and other parts of the
world, and in 2016 filed additional patent applications to use it
against coronaviruses. But the company's application for coronavirus use
is still pending, Mr. McKeel said.

``Gilead has no influence over whether a patent office issues a patent
to the Chinese researchers,'' he added.

In its statement, the virology institute said it would not exercise its
patent rights ``if relevant foreign companies intend to contribute to
the prevention and control of China's epidemic.''

The report from China published on Tuesday about remdesivir also found
that chloroquine, a cheap drug used for decades to treat malaria, could
also fight the new coronavirus. Researchers are recommending that it
also be studied, along with various antiviral medications, including
some of the ones used to treat H.I.V.
