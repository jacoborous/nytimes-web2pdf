Data}\label{fda-orders-companies-to-submit-antibody-test-data}}

The agency had come under fire from members of Congress and other groups
for allowing dozens of wildly inaccurate tests to proliferate without
oversight.

The
F\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/health/fda-antibody-tests-coronavirus.html}{ood
and Drug Administration} announced on Monday that companies selling
coronavirus antibody tests must submit data proving accuracy within the
next 10 days or face removal from the market.

The antibody tests are an effort to detect whether a person had been
infected with the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/health/fda-antibody-tests-coronavirus.html}{coronavirus},
but results have been widely varied. Since mid-March, the agency has
permitted dozens of manufacturers to sell the tests without providing
evidence that they are accurate.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/health/fda-antibody-tests-coronavirus.html}{F.D.A.'s}
action follows
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/health/coronavirus-antibody-tests.html?searchResultPosition=7}{a
report} by more than 50 scientists, which found that only three out of
14 antibody tests gave consistently reliable results, and even the best
had flaws. An evaluation by the National Institutes of Health, working
with other federal health agencies, has also found ``a concerning
number'' of commercial tests that are performing poorly, the F.D.A.
said.

The agency has also been under fire from several members of Congress,
with numerous lawmakers raising questions about the validity of some of
the tests.

So far, little is known about whether those who became ill will develop
immunity and, if so, for how long, and that leaves the value of antibody
tests still uncertain. Around the globe, government and health officials
have hoped that antibody tests would be a critical tool to help
determine when it would be safe to lift stay-at-home restrictions and
reopen businesses. The tests might also be used to identify potential
donors of ``convalescent plasma,'' an approach in which blood plasma
containing antibodies from a recovered individual is used to treat a
Covid-19 patient, the F.D.A. said.

The highly infectious disease has now killed nearly 70,000 **** people
and sickened more than 1.1 million in the United States alone.

While 12 companies have been given F.D.A. clearance to sell the antibody
tests, many other products do not have agency authorization. The result
has been a confusing landscape in which tests by established companies
such as Abbott Laboratories, Cellex and most recently, Roche
Diagnostics, are competing with unapproved tests made by unknown
companies and sold by U.S. distributors with spotty track records. The
F.D.A. has blocked imports of some antibody tests at the U.S. border,
and has ordered some distributors to revise claims about what
individuals can learn from them, or halt sales.

House Democrats Raja Krishnamoorthi, of Illinois, and Rosa DeLauro, of
Connecticut, have both criticized the agency for its handling of the
matter as has Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas.

``The administration's original serology testing policy, which allowed
tests on the market with no F.D.A. review, felt like an overreaction to
the criticism they faced for their slow rollout of molecular tests,''
Mr. Krishnamoorthi said. ``But F.D.A. went too far, completely
abrogating regulatory responsibility.''

Overseeing development of coronavirus tests has been rocky from the
start, with President Trump and others urging the agency to relax rules
for commercial tests.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/fda-coronavirus-testing.html}{Beginning
in late February, the agency} came under fire for taking too long to
allow private companies to get diagnostic tests for the coronavirus onto
the market. Now, the F.D.A. faces additional scrutiny for permitting
manufacturers to distribute the antibody tests too quickly without proof
of efficacy.

``Every step this agency has taken in response to Covid-19 has been a
balance of risk and benefits,'' said Dr. Stephen Hahn, the F.D.A.
commissioner, in a telephone call with reporters on Monday.

In a statement on Monday, Dr. Anand Shah, the F.D.A. deputy commissioner
for medical and scientific affairs, and Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of
the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, defended the agency's
initial policy, saying the tests were never intended to be used as the
sole basis for determining whether anyone had been infected.

``We unfortunately see unscrupulous actors marketing fraudulent test
kits and using the pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of
Americans' anxiety,'' they said in the statement. ``Some test developers
have falsely claimed their serology tests are F.D.A. approved or
authorized. Others have falsely claimed that their tests can diagnose
Covid-19 or that they are for at-home testing.''

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

Dr. Shah and Dr. Shuren also pointed to the N.I.H. evaluation that
showed a number of tests producing faulty results. The F.D.A. declined
to provide details on the number of tests that were studied, or how many
did not work. They also said that the F.D.A. is reviewing more than 200
antibody tests to determine whether they work well enough to get the
agency's go-ahead.

Scott Becker, the chief executive of the Association of Public Health
Laboratories, was pleased by the F.D.A.'s announcement, which he said
would improve the quality of antibody tests. He also said the crackdown
comes six weeks too late.

``The Food and Drug Administration made the right decision by walking
back its policy on serology testing for Covid-19,'' Mr. Becker said.
``We've long been concerned that allowing tests on the market that have
not been approved and authorized for use is a recipe for disaster.''

In addition, as states and cities look for ways to reopen businesses,
Dr. Hahn said on Monday: ``Whether a test should be a ticket for someone
to go back to work as the sole item, my opinion on that would be no,
because there are a lot of unanswered questions.''
