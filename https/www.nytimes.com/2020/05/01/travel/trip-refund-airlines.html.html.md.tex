There's a reason we are deliberately pounding the topic of travel
refunds into the ground: It's a big deal and there's lots of confusion
and contradictory information out there.

In September 2019 B.C. --- ``before coronavirus'' --- my family and I
booked a round-trip flight from Tampa, Fla., to London with British
Airways, scheduled to depart in March. Then the coronavirus hit and our
flight was canceled by the airline. We contacted British Airways to
request a refund, but they have refused, stating they will only provide
a voucher for future use. Philip

By now, you've probably read a number of coronavirus-related stories
about refunds for canceled travel plans --- I've written a handful
myself. But there's a reason we're deliberately pounding the topic into
the ground: It's a big deal and there's lots of confusion and
contradictory information out there.

To begin, airlines are required to issue cash refunds when they cancel
(or significantly delay) flights because of the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/coronavirus-updates.html}{coronavirus
pandemic.} That applies to domestic airlines as well as international
airlines for canceled flights to, within or from the United States.

As you know,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html}{travel
restrictions and closed borders} have asphyxiated commercial aviation;
airlines have slashed
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/travel/international-airlines-service-cuts-coronavirus.html}{routes
and schedules.} As of last month, airlines
\href{https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/ceoblog/passenger-tickets-refunds/}{still
owed passengers \$35 billion} for flights that could not or cannot take
place, according to the International Air Transport Association, an
industry group.

In an emailed statement, a British Airways spokeswoman said that you
are, in fact, entitled to a refund; the airline's customer service team
has reached out to you to resolve the issue. ``If a customer's flight
has been canceled, they should call us to discuss their options. They
can rebook, refund or choose to take a voucher to fly at a later date,''
she said.

The fact that you called and were initially told the exact opposite
tracks with scores of other readers who feel that refunds have been
turned into an all-out game of Frogger.

``At best, airlines are just hiding the fact that customers are owed
refunds if they want one,'' said Scott Keyes, an aviation industry
expert and the founder of the website
\href{https://scottscheapflights.com/}{Scott's Cheap Flights}. ``At
worst, they're actively not giving those refunds even when they're
asked. The thinking is: Right now we are in such a cash crunch that we
want to maintain as much cash as possible --- we can deal with the
reputation ramifications and legal ramifications down the road.''

Micky, another reader, got an email from Delta Air Lines with the
subject line: ``Your Trip Has Been Canceled.'' The body of the message
stated that a canceled plane ticket had been turned into an eCredit;
there were zero mentions of refunds.

I reached out to Delta (which just posted its first quarterly loss in
five years) and was able to get Micky a refund. I also got the direct
link to the refund form
(\href{https://www.delta.com/refunds/refundsHomeAction.action}{here it
is}), which is otherwise buried in the FAQs on Delta's
\href{https://www.delta.com/us/en/travel-update-center/overview}{coronavirus
landing page.}

``To save customers time, we proactively issued eCredits so they could
easily reschedule without having to wait further. That said, customers
whose flights have been canceled or significantly delayed by Delta are
absolutely eligible for refunds upon request, in keeping with our
longstanding policy. We'll evaluate opportunities to clarify this in
future correspondence,'' said a company spokeswoman.

Last month, fueled by a surge in passenger complaints, the United States
Department of Transportation issued a statement reminding airlines of
their duty to issue refunds for canceled flights. But enforcement has
been less than straightforward.

Class-action lawsuits against several major airlines, including Delta,
Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, are certain to crank up the
pressure. In the meantime, there are three concrete things one can try
that don't involve hiring a lawyer.

First, send the airline a direct message on social media. It may sound
sophomoric, but several industry players have told me (anecdotally) that
this can be a consistently reliable tactic. One reader also shared her
luck with this approach.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

``Delta did not notify us, but I saw online that the flights were
canceled,'' Linda wrote. ``No emails. No phone calls. Nothing got a
refund confirmation. Well, until I sent a private instant message
through Facebook. Almost immediate reply. Asked for our names and
confirmation number. Bingo. Refund confirmation received.''

The second course of action is to
\href{https://airconsumer.dot.gov/escomplaint/ConsumerForm.cfm}{file a
complaint} with the transportation department. The federal agency tracks
complaints by airline and releases them monthly; March complaints will
be released in May and April complaints will be released in June. That
data will be used by the department's Aviation Enforcement Office to
monitor airlines' compliance with the refund policy, according to an
agency spokeswoman.

Last tip: If you do manage to get an airline representative on the
phone, do everything you can to get yourself passed around to another
agent if the initial point of contact is unwilling to budge. That may
mean asking to speak with a manager or asking to be transferred to a
different department (then asking to be transferred back). Be patient;
you'll need a good chunk of time in order to let your options play out.

Or, as Mr. Keyes recently
