Saying the country had no active coronavirus cases and no new
infections, officials declared that the strict clampdown on public life
would end.

Crowds will gather again in New Zealand's restaurants. Weddings will
include as many hugs and guests as the happy couple wants --- and even
social distancing will not be needed.

New Zealand has no active coronavirus cases and no new cases, officials
said on Monday, declaring that life could return to a form of
pre-pandemic normal. Since the pandemic began, the country has reported
1,504 cases and 22 deaths nationally, and has been widely praised for
its stringent approach to combating the virus.

``While the job is not done, there is no denying this is a milestone,''
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, adding: ``Thank you, New Zealand.''

The country of five million people is one of only a few nations that
appear to have eradicated the virus, at least for now.
\href{https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/how-iceland-beat-the-coronavirus}{Iceland
is another}.

Ms. Ardern, who led an approach she described as ``go hard, go early''
--- with
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/world/asia/jacinda-ardern-coronavirus-new-zealand.html}{a
severe lockdown that began in late March} --- said the country could now
focus on economic recovery and bolstering local businesses. She also
noted that she ``did a little dance'' when she heard the news that the
virus had been eliminated in the country.

``Retail is back without limitation,'' she said. ``Hospitality is back
without limitation; public transport and travel across the country is
fully open.''

The country had already begun to ease some initial measures first put in
place on March 25 when it shut most businesses, closed schools and
required residents to stay at home. At the time, the country outlined a
four-stage plan to move toward some semblance of normalcy.

Those restrictions were walked back over the past five weeks, moving to
Level 3 in April, and then Level 2 in mid-May. The move to Level 1 had
been planned for June 22, but was brought forward when no new cases were
reported. The restrictions lifted at midnight Monday.

Many have applauded the announcement, including Helen Clarke, a former
prime minister of New Zealand,
\href{https://twitter.com/HelenClarkNZ/status/1269912138090336258}{who
posted on Twitter}: ``Clear leadership \& an engaged public have
produced this result. Principles of inclusion, resilience \&
sustainability should now guide recovery in NZ \& globally.''

The return to freedom of movement, however, is not quite complete. With
the pandemic continuing to rage elsewhere, the country's borders are
still closed.

are in the works, but moving slowly.

Ms. Ardern also announced that QR codes would be appearing wherever
people gather. She asked businesses to remind people to scan the codes
into the government's contact tracing app to make any future outbreak
easier to track and isolate.

``This is a key new habit we're asking all New Zealanders to adopt,''
she said.

Ms. Ardern has been praised internationally for her approach to New
Zealand's outbreak,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/world/asia/jacinda-ardern-coronavirus-new-zealand.html}{which
was among the most stringent in the world}. Her live video updates on
Facebook, streamed from her own home, offered a relatable understanding
of the impact of the coronavirus lockdown on the lives of New
Zealanders, but a firm resolve to eradicate the disease from the
country.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without
    symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more
    than 200 other experts, who
    \href{https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798}{have

Her approach focused on framing the effort of the nation as one of
cooperation, often referring to her fellow New Zealanders as a ``team of
five million'' tasked with keeping each other healthy.

But despite her clear elation about reaching the goal of no active
cases, she urged vigilance as the country moved ahead.

``The virus will be in our world for some time to come,'' she said on
Monday. ``We are confident we have eliminated transmission of the virus
for now, but elimination is not a point in time; it is a sustained
effort.''

Ms. Ardern noted that the last known patient treated at hospital with
Covid-19 was released 12 days ago.

``This is really good news for the person concerned, and it's also
something the rest of New Zealand can take heart from,'' Dr. Ashley
Bloomfield, the director general of health,
\href{https://www.health.govt.nz/news-media/media-releases/no-active-cases-covid-19}{said
in a statement}.

While Dr. Bloomfield called the moment a ``significant mark in our
journey,'' he warned that the ``ongoing vigilance'' against the virus
would be essential going forward.
