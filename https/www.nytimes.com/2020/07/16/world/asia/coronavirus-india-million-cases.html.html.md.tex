Several states and cities have reimposed total and partial lockdowns as
the pandemic accelerates. India now ranks third in the world in
infections.

NEW DELHI --- India hit a milestone on Friday morning that it had made
great sacrifices to avoid: recording more than one million coronavirus
infections.

The virus has been gnawing its way across this country of 1.3 billion
people and gaining speed, fueled by high population density, an already
beleaguered health care system and a calculation by the central
government to lift a nationwide lockdown in hopes of getting the economy
up and running, come what may.

But as India's number of confirmed new infections keeps hitting record
highs, many states and cities have been locking down again. In some
areas, long lines of bodies snake out of cremation grounds. India is now
racking up about 30,000 new reported infections each day --- more than
any other country except the United States and Brazil, and it is
catching up to Brazil.

India now has the third-highest total cases --- 1,003,832 cases and
25,602 deaths --- after the United States and Brazil. Researchers at the
\href{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3635047}{Massachusetts
Institute of Technology} estimate that by the end of next year, India
will be the worst-hit country in the world.

``We have paid a price for laxity,'' **** said K. Srinath Reddy,
president of the Public Health Foundation of India, a nonprofit
organization of public health experts and academics.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/16/world/16india-million-cases02/merlin_174423201_ced70124-ba24-4ba7-8840-822730c3b9c0-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

About 25,000 deaths have been officially attributed to Covid-19, but
testing remains sparse, so the real figure could be significantly
higher.

Schools and universities have been shut since March with no clear plans
to reopen, leaving nearly 278 million students without much to do.

The central government recently advised school systems to limit online
learning to a few hours a day. Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, India's
minister for human resource development, said this was required to make
sure that students didn't get ``overly stretched or stressed.''

More than 100 million Indians have lost their jobs. The economy, which
already had been showing deep cracks before the pandemic, is now
\href{https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/icra-sees-india-real-gdp-contract-by-almost-double-digits-in-fy21}{forecast
to contract by as much as 9.5 percent} in the year that began on April
1, a stunning reversal from the last decade, when India had one of the
hottest economies on earth.

In the early days of the pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took
swift action. He advised masks and social distancing. At a time when
India had fewer than 1,000 known infections --- though the true figure
was certainly higher --- he imposed a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html}{severe
nationwide lockdown} that would last nearly three months.

Millions of migrant laborers, who over the years had gravitated to jobs
in the cities, suddenly found themselves with little or no work. They
poured out of the cities and back into the countryside, hoping to rely
on relatives in their home villages to survive. In the process, they
spread coronavirus infections into nearly every corner of India.

As the economic pain really began to bite, Mr. Modi changed course. Last
month he urged the leaders of India's 28 states and 8 territories to
``unlock, unlock, unlock.''

Public health experts say Mr. Modi got it backward and should have
waited until the crisis was further along, and then imposed a strict
lockdown.

The early lockdown was ``premature and it did nothing'' because the
virus hadn't spread at the time, said Dr. Anand Krishnan, a professor of
epidemiology at the New Delhi-based All India Institute of Medical
Sciences. ``Now is the time to impose such drastic public health
measures.''

The worst hit areas are India's biggest cities, like Mumbai, New Delhi,
Chennai, Ahmedabad and the tech hub of Bengaluru. The crowded urban
areas, where many families live eight or even ten people per room, make
social distancing nearly impossible, hastening the spread of the highly
contagious coronavirus.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for

    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''

Officials in India's northeastern state of Bihar imposed a two-week
lockdown beginning Thursday after a sudden spike in cases --- more than
20,000 in 24 hours. Bihar is a source of migrant labor across India; the
surge in Bihar's cases correlates with the return of workers from
distant cities.

A sharp rise in cases has also forced a new lockdown in Goa, a state on
India's western coast that is famed for its beaches, just a few weeks
after it reopened to tourists, a lifeline to the state economy.

The southern state of Kerala, which had been largely successful in
controlling the spread of the virus, also extended lockdown restrictions
by a week in its biggest city, Thiruvananthapuram, after cases nearly
doubled in just a few days.

``We need more focus on the new COVID-19 hot spot in South Asia,''
\href{https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/press-release/red-cross-red-crescent-braces-covid-spike-south-asia/}{said
a statement from John Fleming}, an official with the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ``Lives of people in
India are no less valuable than people in other parts of the world.''

Mr. Modi and top government officials have repeatedly said in televised
speeches that India is doing better than richer countries, especially
when it comes to the death rate. India has reported about 20
coronavirus-related deaths per million people, while many other nations,
including the United States, Brazil, Spain, Italy have all lost hundreds
per million.

``I don't think it has anything to do with how the government has
handled the pandemic,'' Dr. Krishnan said. Instead, he said, it's
because India's average age is younger than that of other countries, and
obesity and diabetes, which increase people's vulnerability to the
virus, are less prevalent here.

The Indian Medical Association, said that Covid-19 has killed 99
doctors.

``If Covid mortality has to be lessened, it has to start with doctors,''
the organization said in a
\href{https://twitter.com/IMAIndiaOrg/status/1283324001096306689/photo/1}{news
release} Wednesday.

Public health experts say India still lacks a transparent and robust
mechanism to respond to a crisis of this magnitude. And what's needed,
they say, is a vigorous and energetic response from both the government
and citizens.

``Opening malls and allowing large religious gatherings is not the
way,'' said Mr. Reddy. ``You can't give the virus a highway to travel.''
