WASHINGTON --- A 52-year-old man was put to death on Friday for the 1993
murders of five people, the third federal execution this week after a
17-year hiatus of federal capital punishment.

The execution of Dustin Lee Honken proceeded without any last-minute
delays, unlike those of the two other federal inmates who had been put
to death in previous days. The Supreme Court dismissed a challenge to
the Justice Department's execution protocol early Thursday, clearing the
way for his lethal injection on Friday afternoon. Mr. Honken was
pronounced dead at 4:36 p.m. at the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute,
Ind.

He spoke only briefly in his final moments, according to a journalist
who observed the execution.

``Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for me,'' Mr. Honken said.

The Justice Department announced its intention last summer to revive
federal capital punishment. But questions over the constitutionality of
the lethal injection protocol ---~using a single drug, pentobarbital ---
delayed its resumption.

A spate of last-minute legal challenges had forced the Justice
Department to postpone the executions of Daniel Lewis Lee, 47, and
Wesley Ira Purkey, 68. A federal judge in Washington issued stays to
delay their deaths on Monday and Wednesday, citing constitutional issues
with the proposed execution protocol.

The Supreme Court acted swiftly in both cases, vacating the preliminary
injunctions hours afterward. Mr. Lee was executed Tuesday morning, and
Mr. Purkey on Thursday.

Mr. Honken was indicted in 1993 on a charge of conspiracy to manufacture
methamphetamine. One of his two dealers, Greg Nicholson, had secretly
recorded Mr. Honken, prompting his arrest, and later testified against
him before a grand jury.

Days before his scheduled plea hearing, Mr. Honken and his girlfriend,
Angela Johnson, traveled to Mr. Nicholson's home in Iowa and forced him
to record a statement of Mr. Honken's innocence. They kidnapped Mr.
Nicholson along with his girlfriend and her two daughters, 6 and 10, and
killed them in the woods.

Months later, Mr. Honken and Ms. Johnson killed his other dealer for
fear that he would testify against Mr. Honken. The court dismissed those
charges because two witnesses went missing.

Both Mr. Honken and Ms. Johnson were ultimately condemned to death for
the murders, but a judge overturned Ms. Johnson's sentence because her
counsel did not present evidence of her deteriorated mental health. She
is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.

Religious advisers to Mr. Honken argued that he had changed since his
conviction. Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin, at the time the archbishop of
Indianapolis, visited Mr. Honken and said he had witnessed ``spiritual
growth in faith and compassion.''

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

``He is serene about the future and tries to show solace for his
companions on death row,'' Cardinal Tobin, now the archbishop of Newark,
wrote in a plea to President Trump to commute Mr. Honken's sentence. The
four Catholic bishops in Iowa, where Mr. Honken's crimes occurred, also
called for the president to spare his life. The Catholic Church opposes
the death penalty.

The Rev. Mark O'Keefe, the spiritual adviser during Mr. Honken's
execution at the prison in Terre Haute, said that scheduling it during
the coronavirus pandemic put him and older nuns to whom he administers
communion at risk. Father O'Keefe and Mr. Purkey's spiritual adviser
sued the Justice Department, arguing that the timing of the executions
burdened their right to free exercise of religion. The Supreme Court
dismissed those claims early Thursday morning.

Mr. Honken was the first Iowa inmate to be put to death since 1963; the
state abolished capital punishment two years later.

In a statement, Shawn Nolan, his lawyer, said that his client had
repented for his crimes and worked to redeem himself.

``There was no reason for the government to kill him, in haste or at
all,'' Mr. Nolan said. ``In any case, they failed. The Dustin Honken
they wanted to kill is long gone.''
