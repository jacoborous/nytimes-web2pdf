Isaias, the ninth named storm system of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane
season, strengthened into a hurricane on Friday.

Isaias, the ninth named storm system of the busy 2020 hurricane season,
strengthened into a hurricane early Friday morning, according to the
National Hurricane Center.

The storm, which battered parts of Puerto Rico and the Dominican
Republic on Thursday, was expected to travel up the eastern
\href{https://twitter.com/NHC_Atlantic/status/1288945960547123210}{coast
of Florida} and
\href{https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/234050.shtml?key_messages\#contents}{continue
north}, potentially bringing heavy winds, rain and flash flooding,
\href{https://twitter.com/NHC_Atlantic/status/1289128870101184514}{according
to the center}.

On Friday morning, Isaias was southeast of the Bahamas and moving
northwest at 17 miles per hour with maximum sustained winds of 80 m.p.h.
The storm was lashing the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos
Islands with strong winds and heavy squalls, the center said.

Hurricane Isaias could reach Florida on Saturday.

Isaias was expected to produce flash flooding and mudslides across the
Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and Turks and Caicos, the center
added, and hurricane conditions were expected over portions of the
Bahamas on Friday.

A hurricane warning was issued for the northwestern Bahamas, and
tropical storm conditions were possible for the east coast of Florida on
Saturday.

The center said there were risks from winds, heavy rainfall and storm
surge late this weekend on the northeastern Florida coast and northward
along the East Coast through early next week. The ``entire U.S. East
Coast should monitor'' Isaias, the center said.

On Wednesday, the Florida Division of Emergency Management announced
that all state-sponsored coronavirus testing sites would close at 5 p.m.
Thursday. The department later said that state-sponsored sites in 11
counties
\href{https://twitter.com/FLSERT/status/1288974249194147840}{would
remain open}.

The other sites would be closed until it was safe to reopen, which is
expected to be no later than 8 a.m. Wednesday,
\href{https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/FLDEM/bulletins/297ef6d}{according
to a statement}.

``All sites have free-standing structures including tents and other
equipment, which cannot withstand tropical storm force winds, and could
cause damage to people and property if not secured,'' the statement
said.

As the storm passes through the state, testing sites will reopen on a
rolling basis, and symptomatic Floridians were encouraged to pick up a
self-swab test from any of the
\href{https://floridadisaster.org/covid19/testing-sites/}{testing
sites}.

On Wednesday alone, Florida reported more than 9,400 new coronavirus
cases and 216 deaths. There have been
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/florida-coronavirus-cases.html}{more
than 461,000 cases} of coronavirus and more than 6,500 deaths since the
beginning of the pandemic in the state, a New York Times database shows.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

Emergency managers this year have been wary of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/us/hurricane-pandemic-coronavirus-florida.html}{what
might happen if a major hurricane strikes during the coronavirus
pandemic}. Evacuation orders often put people in close contact with one
another in shelters, which would make maintaining social distancing and
other safety measures against the virus difficult to maintain.

Over the weekend, officials in Hawaii worried that space at shelters
could be limited because of social distancing policies if
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/us/hurricane-douglas-hawaii.html}{Hurricane
Douglas} hit the islands grimly. The American Red Cross also faced
obstacles recruiting volunteers to run the state's shelters because of
anxieties surrounding exposure to the coronavirus.

Last week, Hanna
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/us/hanna-storm-texas.html}{hit
the southern coastal region of Texas as a Category 1 hurricane}, taking
aim at some of the same communities that have seen a sudden spike in
Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. As the storm neared the coast, the
mayor of Corpus Christi urged people who had taken in relatives to wear
masks in their homes; San Antonio opened a reception center for people
who had fled their homes, where officials handed out vouchers for hotel
rooms.

The Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 through Nov. 30,
has been a busy one. The first tropical storm was Arthur,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/us/tropical-storm-arthur-2020-path.html}{which
formed off the coast of Florida in May}, followed by
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/us/bertha-storm.html}{Bertha},
which made landfall near Charleston, S.C., later that month. The systems
made 2020 the sixth year in a row that a storm developed before the
official start of the season.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
\href{https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/busy-atlantic-hurricane-season-predicted-for-2020}{predicted
an above normal Atlantic hurricane season}, with as many as 19 named
storms --- of which six to 10 could become hurricanes. And three to six
of those could develop into Category 3, 4 or 5 hurricanes.

An average hurricane season usually produces 12 named storms, with six
becoming hurricanes and three of those six developing into major
hurricanes.

An analysis of observational data of satellite images since 1979 by
researchers suggests that
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/climate/climate-changes-hurricane-intensity.html}{climate
change} is making hurricanes stronger and more destructive.
