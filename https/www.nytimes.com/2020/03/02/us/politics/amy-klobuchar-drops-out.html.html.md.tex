Biden}\label{amy-klobuchar-drops-out-of-presidential-race-and-endorses-biden}}

Ms. Klobuchar made her decision hours before Super Tuesday. She shocked
the primary field with a third-place finish in New Hampshire, but
ultimately could not compete with better-funded rivals.

DALLAS ---
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/politics/klobuchar-minneapolis-george-floyd.html}{Senator
Amy Klobuchar} of Minnesota, who entered the Democratic presidential
race with an appeal to moderate voters and offered herself as a
candidate who could win in Midwestern swing states, dropped out of the
race on Monday and endorsed a rival, former Vice President
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.}

``Today I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden for president,''
she said at a rally here for the former vice president. She added: ``He
can bring our country together and build that coalition of our fired-up
Democratic base as well as independents and moderate Republicans. We do
not in our party want to just eke by a victory. We want to win big.''

The decision came one day after
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-drops-out.html}{former
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., departed the race}, and after
weeks of Democratic Party hand-wringing about a crowded field of
moderate candidates splitting a finite field of centrist votes, allowing
Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html}{Bernie
Sanders} of Vermont to march forward as the front-runner among
progressives and amass delegates. Both Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg
appeared with
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/podcasts/the-daily/the-stakes-on-super-tuesday.html}{Mr.
Biden} at events in Dallas Monday night and endorsed him.

Ms. Klobuchar began discussing a possible end with her campaign manager,
Justin Buoen, on Sunday morning. But the candidate arrived at her final
decision on Monday morning, catching some staff members by surprise as
they were still making plans for campaign events later this week, and as
her ad team was still making future reservations. Her rally in Salt Lake
City on Monday morning carried no indication that she had any intention
of dropping out of the race.

Her exit means that her home state is up for grabs on Tuesday, as are
its 75 pledged delegates. Mr. Sanders won Minnesota in 2016 and had been
polling just a few percentage points behind Ms. Klobuchar there.

At the rally on Monday night, Ms. Klobuchar turned to the dozens of
television cameras and asked people ``from my home state of Minnesota''
to ``vote for Joe.''

``Vote for decency, vote for dignity, vote for a heart for our
country,'' she said. ``That is what he will bring to the White House.''

In a call with her staff on Monday morning, Ms. Klobuchar said she was
proud of her ``happy, scrappy campaign.''

``I've been so proud that people have been willing to pitch in and help
each other,'' she said, according to an excerpt from the call. ``And so
that's why this is a really hard thing to do today. But I really step
back and think, `What is the best thing for us, and not just me, but our
whole team?' And I keep trying to think of what is best for our country
right now. So I decided that I'm going to be endorsing Vice President
Biden today.''

Ms. Klobuchar, despite a strong third-place finish in New Hampshire,
lagged her moderate rivals in every other state and was often seen as a
candidate siphoning support. Though she had varying levels of support
across the Super Tuesday map, polling within reach of leading candidates
in some predominantly Republican states with open primaries, it is
unclear how much of a boost any of her rivals will see in the wake of
Ms. Klobuchar's exit, or where she may direct her seven delegates.

The senator from Minnesota shocked her rivals with her performance in
New Hampshire, finishing ahead of better-known candidates like Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html}{Elizabeth
Warren} of Massachusetts and Mr. Biden.

But aside from New Hampshire, Ms. Klobuchar struggled deeply, lagging
all of her competitors in Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina. Though her
campaign received a much-needed influx of cash after New Hampshire ---
\$12 million in just over a week --- it proved too little, too late for
the campaign to rapidly scale up and compete with her better funded and
better organized rivals.

The Klobuchar campaign was constantly rescheduling events, often
releasing public advisories for an event with less than 24 hours'
advance notice. One ``get out the caucus'' rally in Nevada at Rancho
High School attracted less than 100 people. Days before, Mr. Buttigieg
brought more than 1,200 to the same school.

Ms. Klobuchar was forced to cancel a rally in her own backyard Sunday
night, after protesters from Black Lives Matter and local civil rights
groups took over the stage in St. Louis Park, Minn. They were calling
attention to the case of Myon Burrell,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-myon-burrell.html}{a
black man convicted of murder as a teenager} while Ms. Klobuchar was
county attorney.

Recent news reports have
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/us/klobuchar-prosecutor-myon-burrell.html}{raised
questions about the case}, including numerous reported flaws with the
prosecution. Ms. Klobuchar, while stopping short of apologizing, has
called for the case to be reviewed.

The frantic scramble to build out a national campaign followed a
diligent and relentless focus on Iowa. Ms. Klobuchar was the first 2020
candidate to visit all 99 counties, and spent most of her time, money
and field staff deployed to the state. Her self-described ``gritty''
effort in Iowa kept her on the debate stage, meeting polling thresholds
in early states rather than in national polls.

  From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is ``The Daily.''
  Today:
\item
  archived recording (crowd)\\
  Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie!
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

In the first weeks of the Democratic primaries, Bernie Sanders was the
only candidate to win big. And to win repeatedly.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (bernie sanders)\\
  We won the popular vote in Iowa, we won the New Hampshire primary, and
  according to three networks and the A.P., we have now won the Nevada
  caucus! {[}CHEERING{]}
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

In Nevada, he did it through sheer popularity by proving he'd built a
coalition, one made up of union workers, people with college degrees and
Hispanic voters. In Iowa and New Hampshire, he did it by narrowly
beating out his moderate rivals who split the majority of the vote, with
the leading moderate candidate, Joe Biden, losing support and stumbling
badly.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  The only gas that powers a candidate to the nomination is these
  delegates, and Sanders now has 43 of them. That's more than his
  closest rival Pete Buttigieg at 26. And now you can see Sanders also
  has more than triple the number of delegates of most other people in
  this race.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

All of this left Sanders the front-runner ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  Down-ballot Democrats are very worried about Bernie ending up at the
  top of the ballot, but there's speculation that the rest of the folks
  --- the moderates and others --- can't get it together, and they can't
  stop Bernie.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

--- and the only one who could walk away from Super Tuesday, today, as
the likely Democratic nominee.

Then came South Carolina.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Just days ago, the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy
  dead. Now, thanks to all of you, the heart of the Democratic Party, we
  just won and we've won big because of you.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

And for the first time ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (crowd)\\
  Let's go Joe! Let's go Joe! Let's go Joe!
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

--- Joe Biden offered a vision of a different coalition, this one made
up of black voters, older voters and suburbanites.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  Joe Biden lapped the field with 48 percent of the vote, winning every
  single county in the state, crushing Bernie Sanders by more than a 2-1
  margin, with everyone else trailing badly. Biden's big win helped him
  close the delegate gap considerably with Sanders. It's very close.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

But South Carolina was just three days ago.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  Despite Biden's big night, the confetti could stop for him on Super
  Tuesday, as Sanders is much better organized and positioned to take a
  potentially commanding delegate lead.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

And so the question now is, will Sanders sweep? Or, will the moderate
wing of the party coalesce around Biden, and will the voters who had
left him come back in time for Super Tuesday? It's Tuesday, March 3.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  We are on a residential street in Arlington, Virginia. It's a quite
  lovely neighborhood of colonial houses. I think it's safe to say
  well-off. An affluent suburban community.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  Can I do one of my favorite things?
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Which is what?
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  To look up how much these homes sell for?
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  You would not be the first New Yorker to do that.
\item
  clare toeniskoetter\\
  So this house right behind us --- four beds, three baths, 2,600 square
  feet. Estimated price: \$1.3 million.

  This house here, \$1.3 million.

  No one's ever going to invite me to their home after hearing this.
  {[}LAUGHS{]} They've still got a Christmas tree.
\item
  knocking on door
\item
  interposing voices\\
  Oh! Cute dog. Hi.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

You must be Brian.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  brian keane\\
  I'm Brian.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  I'm Michael.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Hey, Michael. How are you?
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Jess, Clare.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Jess, how are you? Nice to meet you.
\item
  jessica cheung\\
  Hi! Nice to meet you.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Clare, Brian KEANE. How are you? Nice to meet you.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  May we come in?
\item
  brian keane\\
  Of course, of course. Nice to meet you.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

So on Sunday night I went with my colleagues Jessica Cheung and Clare
Toeniskoetter to meet Brian Keane at his house in Arlington, a suburb
about 15 minutes outside Washington, D.C.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  jessica cheung\\
  So cute in here. They've even got a fire going on.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

We get there ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kate sawyer keane\\
  I'm Kate. Nice to meet you.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

--- and he introduces us to his kids.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  brian keane\\
  So you met Tommy. And this is Julia, and this is Maddie, and this is
  Jack.
\item
  jack keane\\
  Hello.
\item
  brian keane\\
  And you met {[}INAUDIBLE{]} right?
\item
  kate sawyer keane\\
  I just wanted to ---
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  There are so many of you!
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

All five of them.

And his dog, a yellow lab named Annie. And then we sit down in his
living room.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So, with your permission, we'll start.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Yes.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Tell me who you are and what you do.
\item
  brian keane\\
  So my name is Brian Keane, and I'm 52 years old. We're here in
  Arlington, Virginia.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

So Brian, like a lot of people in Arlington, used to work on Capitol
Hill. His wife is a partner at a law firm that represents, among many
clients, the Democratic National Committee. He now runs a nonprofit
organization and a software company, both of them focused on renewable
energy.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So tell me about the politics of this community --- Arlington,
  Virginia.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Sure. It's a wealthy community. And it's a very well-read community,
  if you will. And the reason a lot of people kind of live here is
  because of the politics. And so they move to Washington --- certainly
  that's why I came here, because I love politics.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  What's the kind of character of people's political identification, if
  you could summarize it?
\item
  brian keane\\
  It's pretty easy to assume that they're left of center.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  And you said left of center. My sense of this community is that that
  ``center'' word is important. That it's left of center, but it's not
  liberal ``liberal.'' I went back and looked at the 2016 primary for
  Arlington County and saw that Hillary Clinton won this county by a
  2-to-1 ratio over Bernie Sanders. It wasn't really even close. He got
  32 percent. She got twice as much, 66 percent.
\item
  brian keane\\
  We have a sense that if we're going to be voting, we understand that
  you want to vote for somebody who can be elected, and so you don't
  want to kind of just say like, oh, let's just go crazy and vote for
  Mr. Potato Head because I think he's great, and see what happens.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

But in the most recent polling, which was conducted before South
Carolina, Sanders is actually leading the state of Virginia with 28
percent of the vote. Joe Biden has 19 percent, and Michael Bloomberg has
17 percent, which, as you can probably gather, is not welcome news to
Brian.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (bernie sanders)\\
  Well, look. Let's be clear. The establishment is freaking out. The
  establishment is worried. Wall Street is worried. The drug companies
  are worried. Insurance companies are worried.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

When he and his friends hear Sanders going after the establishment ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  brian keane\\
  When you say Washington's the problem, he's probably talking about us,
  and that's not really well received.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

--- they hear that as him going after them.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  brian keane\\
  Yeah, like any industry town would be, right? So if you're going to
  say, the car manufacturers stink, I think Detroit would take umbrage
  to that.

  He's just a little mean. I don't think I'd like him as my neighbor.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  What about as your Democratic nominee? I mean, what do you ---
\item
  brian keane\\
  I think it would be really, really bad for the party.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Why?
\item
  brian keane\\
  I don't think, for every --- and I really, really think Trump is bad
  for America --- a socialist revolution is not what we're asking we
  need. And if we have a nominee to stand up against Trump that says we
  need a socialist revolution, we're going to lose. And we will lose our
  Senate. We'll lose any strong candidates we have in the Senate, and we
  have a lot of strong candidates.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  You mean it will trickle down over the whole party.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Oh yeah. Badly. Badly.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

This is how you hear a lot of establishment Democrats talking right now,
that a Sanders nomination would trigger a meltdown inside the party.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Given what you just laid out, who do most of your neighbors tend to
  support in this primary?
\item
  brian keane\\
  So it's, I've been all over the board, though. Like it just moves so
  fast. And my personal thing is so interesting, though, because I've
  always --- my heart has always been like, I'm a Joe Biden guy at
  heart.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  What do you mean?
\item
  brian keane\\
  I love the guy, but can you win? And then in that case, it's like, so
  I need to go with a guy that's a person who's going to win. And so now
  I'm, like, ping-ponging back and forth of who can win, who can win,
  and I have to give up the guy I love, you know?
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  You say ``I'm a Joe guy'' with so much conviction that I kind of want
  to go back to understand what you mean by that.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Well, I came to Washington, D.C. to go to college here at American
  University. And this is a long story. Can I tell my long story?
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Please tell a long story. We didn't come here for a short story.
\item
  brian keane\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} You asked for it. But at American University ---
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

But, to summarize: Brian went to college at American University, where
he was the head of an undergraduate group that brought speakers to
campus, and Joe Biden was one of them. This was in 1988, and Biden had
just dropped out of his first presidential run after being caught
plagiarizing a speech. And then he had a brain aneurysm that he barely
survived.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  brian keane\\
  And so the speech he gave for the Kennedy Political Union at A.U. was
  his first speech after having been driven out of the race and his
  aneurysm. So he shows up ---
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  You're there, obviously.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Yes, right. So I'm there. I'm just a senior in college, I'm a kid. And
  he shows up. He gets out of this car, and he's like my best friend.
  He's like, Brian, it's so great to see you! You have no idea how glad
  I am to see you. And I'm like, Senator Biden, so nice to meet you. No,
  you have no idea how glad I am to meet you --- uh, to see you. Not
  meet you. You know, he's very good. It's like, in case he has met me
  before, he's like, so glad to see you! And it was like {[}GASPS{]},
  we're best friends. This is amazing.
\item
  archived recording (brian keane)\\
  {[}APPLAUSE{]} Thank you. Good evening, and welcome to tonight's
  program. My name is Brian F. KEANE, and I am the director of the
  Kennedy Political Union.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Then we go to the lecture hall.
\item

  Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. first entered public service in 1970 when
  he was elected to the Council of Newcastle County --- excuse me --- in
  New Jer--- in Delaware. {[}LAUGHTER{]} Sorry.
\item
  brian keane\\
  And ---
\item
  archived recording (brian keane)\\
  Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Joseph Biden.
\item
  brian keane\\
  --- he gives this unbelievable speech.
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Most of we public officials, when we're about to speak somewhere, we
  start off and we say, I'm really happy to be here. Well folks, I'm
  happy to be here. I'm happy to be anywhere in light of {[}LAUGHS{]}
  the last 8 or 10 months. {[}APPLAUSE{]}
\item
  brian keane\\
  And he kept going.
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  I don't see no leader right now of the Democratic Party who's able to
  unite everyone. The Southern conservatives, the Northern liberals ---

  Yeah. So he gives him his phone, and Joe dials and he goes, hey Beau,

This is actually not the end of the story.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  brian keane\\
  To make this long story longer, that was 1989. So fast forward to
  2007. There's rumors that he's going to run for president. So I'm
  taking the Amtrak, and I get to 30th Street Station and I go up the
  escalator. And I'm like, I think, just to myself, I'm like, I think
  that's Joe Biden over there. And there's a guy just holding the
  newspaper. He's holding it up. And I said, excuse me, Mr. President.
  And he folds the newspaper down, and he looks at me. He looks me in
  the eye, and he goes, ``American University.''
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Wow.
\item
  brian keane\\
  And I go, oh my God! How do you remember that? That was 1989. He goes,
  that was a great night, wasn't it? How are you man? How's it going?
  How are you? And I said, well, are you running for president? And he's
  like, well, why not? Like, why not? And so we got coffee, and then we
  waited in line for the Amtrak. And it was unbelievable.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  What impression did he leave you with?
\item
  brian keane\\
  That he is the best politician. He loves people. And, actually, that
  is what the job is. And if you love people, you're going to do well by
  people.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So this time around, 2020, did you know right away? Did it feel like
  he was going to be your candidate?
\item
  brian keane\\
  Well, I said to my wife, well, I got to go with Joe. We're like best
  friends, you know? And she's like, you don't talk to the guy.

  brian keane\\
  But I think it's amazing that there's a person that can make you feel
  like that.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Right, in the race.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Yes. So Joe enters 2020, and I said, well I got to be with Joe.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Partly because of the relationship you had, partly because of his
  politics, all of it?
\item
  brian keane\\
  Yeah, yeah. And that he is a Democrat's Democrat to me.

\begin{itemize}
\item

  Tell me about what's happened since then.
\item
  brian keane\\
  So I love Joe. Joe's my guy. But he has not been a strong candidate. I
  think he doesn't look good. I think he's not sounding good. And Joe
  Biden, who is a great guy, is playing by a rulebook that was written
  in 1980 maybe, 1972. And that's really concerning to me because Donald
  Trump's going to fillet him very quickly. I mean, we're seeing these
  debates. Joe Biden's version of kind of hand-to-hand combat is to just
  say it louder, is to yell.

  I agree that everybody, once they, in fact --- anyway, my time is up.
  I'm sorry.
\item

  Thank you, Vice President.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  You just felt he was faltering.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Yeah.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So as you're confronting what you see as his weaknesses, you're
  watching these debate performances, it sounds like you're starting to
  flirt with other candidates around this time. And where is your eye
  starting to drift?
\item
  brian keane\\
  To everybody, actually. And then along comes Bloomberg. And there's a
  guy who really does understand social media, and he has the money to
  understand social media. And that's really kind of cool. And on an
  electoral level, he really can go toe-to-toe with Trump on that and
  put his money behind the whole thing to win this thing.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So when it comes to Bloomberg, for you he has this combination of
  values and resources. That's the appeal.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Yeah. And as such, he could win.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  And what about his candidacy so far, if anything, has given you any
  reservations, given you pause?
\item
  brian keane\\
  That he so quickly got off message and kind of got sidetracked.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  In the debates.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Yeah, in the debates. And to me, the problem there is, oh, so now
  you're going to go one-on-one with Trump? Maybe you're not the guy.
  This is a problem. This all a game-day decision for me, right? So it's
  --- election's Tuesday.

  So, you know, can Trump destroy Bloomberg? Can he destroy Biden? Yes
  and yes, perhaps.

  Who has kind of the better heart, and I think I have that answer,
  because Joe is the guy. I love Joe. Who has the money to be able to do
  this? Bloomberg does. But Biden's victory in South Carolina, game
  changer for me.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Really?
\item
  brian keane\\
  Yeah.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Why?
\item
  brian keane\\
  I didn't believe he was going to be able to do that. I didn't believe
  him when he said, it's a firewall. And the numbers are unbelievable.
  It's like, wow. Joe did it. So then you come back to Bloomberg, and
  it's like, well, I don't know.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Sounds like the thing that matters most you was just victory. Is
  seeing Joe Biden, this person who was faltering onstage, you didn't
  like the way he was presenting, suddenly seeming electable because he
  had won an election?
\item
  brian keane\\
  No.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  No?
\item
  brian keane\\
  The winning was really important, but that speech ---
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Thank you, thank you, thank you, South Carolina!
\item
  brian keane\\
  --- really grabbed me.
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Let me talk directly to Democrats across America, especially those who
  will be voting on Super Tuesday.
\item
  brian keane\\
  And it was hopeful, and it laid out an agenda.
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  If Democrats want to nominate someone who will build on Obamacare, not
  scrap it; take on the N.R.A. and gun manufacturers, not protect them;
  stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get
  restored, not raise their taxes and keep the promises we make, then
  join us. And if the Democrats want a nominee who's a Democrat
  {[}CHEERING{]}, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden
  Democrat, join us.
\item
  brian keane\\
  And so now, he's back.
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  So here's the deal. Let's get back up. We're decent. We're brave.
  We're resilient people. We can believe again. We're better than this
  moment. We're better than this president. So get up, take back our
  country. This the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our
  capacity if we do it together. God bless you all, and may God protect
  our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So at the moment --- this is Sunday night, almost 9 o'clock --- you
  are leaning toward Joe Biden. OK. What are the odds that you change
  your mind between now and Super Tuesday?
\item
  brian keane\\
  It's really amazing because I'm just so back and forth and back and
  forth every day. And every hour of every day.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  I want to talk about what I'm hearing you say, because I think this is
  a larger question happening in Virginia on Super Tuesday and part of
  the reason why we're here, which is that it seems like aside from
  defeating Trump, which is your number one priority, a big priority for
  you is not having Bernie Sanders be the nominee. Is that fair to say?
\item
  brian keane\\
  A equals B, and B equals C. Because if my number one issue is to beat
  Trump, then we need the candidate who can do that. So that's really
  the calculus that's happening here.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  But I'm hearing you waffling over these two moderate candidates, Biden
  and Bloomberg. And the latest polling has Sanders with close to what
  he had in 2016 in Arlington. Biden and Bloomberg are around 20 percent
  too, because they're sharing a lot of voters. So if on Super Tuesday,
  Sanders sweeps a bunch of these states, and he wins in places like
  Virginia, it will likely have been because Biden and Bloomberg split
  the vote. And I wonder if you're thinking about that at all.
\item
  brian keane\\
  I am thinking about that. I think every other election has been like,
  oh, I don't watch the polls. I just vote. I vote my heart. I vote the
  issues, you know? But now we're all watching the polls. We're all kind
  of ---
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Gaming.
\item
  brian keane\\
  It's unbelievable, right? We all think we're on CNN and it's like,
  this is crazy. But we feel like we have to because the end game is
  which of these candidates can beat Trump? And that's why I'm going to
  be looking at the polls.

  And I may actually delay my actual vote on Tuesday, unlike like ---
  Usually, I vote before I go to work. But I may vote after work,
  depending on afternoon polling.

  Because if I want to vote for the candidate --- if it looks like
  Virginia can --- let's see if I can say this right.

  If it looks like Bloomberg and Biden, if one of them is going to knock
  off Sanders in Virginia, I will vote for who can do that.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

So to be clear, Brian is saying that on election day, he is going to
watch the early results come in before he goes to place his own vote.
And his logic is that he's going to try to limit the chance that a
moderate split would lead to a Sanders win in Virginia.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  brian keane\\
  I think I'm being part of the solution, because I'm putting so much
  frigging effort into this thing. {[}LAUGHS{]} It's unbelievable, you
  know? And it is. It's amazing. And I think, actually, so many people
  are in my neighborhood and my friends, it's really amazing. And people
  are saying, so what should I do? They're really thinking this through.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

As Brian is talking, what he's describing about the efforts that he and
his friends and his neighbors are making is reminding me of what
happened to the Republicans back in 2016. During the same time that
year, the establishment was paralyzed by Donald Trump's success with
voters in the primaries. They were terrified of it, but they didn't
really know what to do about it and kind of did nothing, really. And
then Trump basically ran away with Super Tuesday, and after that, by the
time party leaders got organized and tried to stop him, it was too late.
And people like Brian are a bit like the Democratic version of the Never
Trump movement. They see Sanders as the Trump of the left, and they're
trying to do everything within their power to avoid that from happening
on their side.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  I keep thinking about the way you've talked about Sanders and the risk
  he poses to the Democratic Party. If Sanders becomes the nominee, if
  it came down to it in a general election, Sanders versus Trump, what
  would you do?
\item
  brian keane\\
  So for me, that's really going to depend on his number two.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  There's not an automatic ``I'm going to be voting for the Democrat''
  coming out of your mouth right now.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Correct. I might take some solace in a youthful vice president.

  Elizabeth Warren could get me for sure, for sure.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Did you ever think you'd be in the position of imagining the
  front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary being a person
  that you can't instantly say, I'd vote for?
\item
  brian keane\\
  I could never imagine that the Democrats would nominate someone who's
  not a Democrat.

  So that's really the answer. And I don't think we'll nominate someone
  who is not a Democrat.
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Do you think that it's inevitably hard for someone who lives in a
  community of expensive houses in suburban Virginia to ever really
  understand why people might want to break the system?
\item
  brian keane\\
  No. I totally understand why people would want to break the system,
  and I really know the system doesn't work for so many people. Millions
  and millions of people. It's not a perfect union. I mean, really
  isn't. But we are trying to create a perfect union. That's kind of the
  beauty of the country. To use the language of revolution, it's not
  responsible, it's not helpful.

  It's not really what we should be doing, especially against Trump.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Well, thank you very much for your time.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Thank you.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  I really appreciate it.
\item
  brian keane\\
  Thank you so much.

In Europe, the E.U. raised its alert level from moderate to high as the
number of infections surged, reaching 18 of the E.U.`s 27 nations. In
South Korea, infections have doubled since Friday to more than 4,300.
And in the U.S., as of Monday night, authorities had reported 100 cases
and, in Washington State, six deaths from the virus.

{[}music{]}

That's it for ``The Daily.'' I'm Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

With a calm but prosecutorial demeanor mixed with a dry sense of humor,
Ms. Klobuchar slowly built momentum through consecutive debate
performances, seeing immediate spikes in cash and volunteers. But she
never experienced a true ``viral moment'' --- something she lamented in
the closing days of her campaign while speaking in Nashville --- forcing
her to run a threadbare operation in every state outside of Iowa.

Ms. Klobuchar famously
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-president-2020.html}{kicked
off her campaign in the middle of a blizzard} a year ago, her nearly
hourlong presidential announcement marked by the piles of snow that
accumulated on her hatless head as she debuted her centrist message.

On the campaign trail, she would refer frequently to her snowy
beginnings as she continually pitched her Midwestern roots as a
presidential credential, arguing that her ``I live here'' heartland
appeal could win back states like Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, which
President Trump carried in 2016.

As a perpetual and direct contrast to the vocal liberal base of the
Democratic Party, Ms. Klobuchar stubbornly stuck to a moderate message,
one she hoped would appeal to independents and moderate Republicans. She
vocally opposed ``Medicare for all,'' and built one of her most popular
stump speech lines around defending the Affordable Care Act, claiming
that it was ``10 points more popular than the guy in the White House
right now.''

Her campaign also amounted to a bet that in a deeply polarized
electorate, a bipartisan voting record could still be viewed as an asset
in the Democratic electorate. She regularly highlighted the more than
100 bills that she had passed during her 14-year Senate career, and
name-checked Republican senators whom she frequently worked with in her
stump speech.

But her bipartisan record also carried some risk; she was among the most
likely Democratic senators to vote for a Trump judicial nominee, a point
seized on by rivals like Mr. Buttigieg in debates.

She struggled more than any other candidate to attract support in
minority communities, particularly among black voters. And she faced
calls from local civil rights organizations in Minneapolis, including
the N.A.A.C.P. chapter, to suspend her campaign over the Burrell case.

As she made her final run, Ms. Klobuchar abandoned South Carolina, the
first state to vote with a meaningful black population, four days early.
And her Super Tuesday campaign swing through 11 different states avoided
the two biggest, and most diverse: Texas and California.

But the senator kept her message upbeat throughout the campaign, and she
always had her New Hampshire finish to point to, as she did in Nashville
a few days before Super Tuesday.

``We have been really, really beating the odds,'' she said.
