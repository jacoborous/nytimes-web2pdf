Tens of thousands of motorcyclists roared into the western South Dakota

of the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.

STURGIS, S.D. --- Tens of thousands of motorcyclists roared into the
western South Dakota community of Sturgis on Friday, lining Main Street
from end to end, for the start of an annual rally that kicked off
despite objections from residents and with little regard for a public
health emergency ravaging the world.

It could have been any other past summer rally in Sturgis, with herds of
R.V.s, bikers and classic cars converging for the Sturgis Motorcycle
Rally, a 10-day affair that was expected to attract roughly 250,000
enthusiasts this year --- about half the number who attended last year
but a figure that puts it on track to be among the country's largest
public gatherings since the first coronavirus cases emerged in the
spring.

Save for a few hard-to-spot hand-sanitizer stations, it could have been
any other major festival in pre-pandemic times.

``Screw Covid I went to Sturgis,'' read a black T-shirt amid a sea of
Harley Davidson and Trump 2020 outfits sported by the throng of people
walking along Main Street. Their gear did not include face masks, and
social distancing guidelines were completely ignored.

South Dakota is among several states that did not put in place a
lockdown, and state officials have not required residents to wear masks,
giving attendees who rode in from outside the state fewer restrictions
than they may have had back home.

Attendance on Friday was on par with previous years, said Dan Ainslie,
City Manager for Sturgis.

``It's kind of like a typical rally,'' Mr. Ainslie said of the number of
people coming into town, ``and the crowds are still building.''

Indeed, fears that the rally could be a superspreader event did not
appear to scare riders from attending. Bikers flocked to tents featuring
tattoo artists, apparel, gear and food.

Health experts say the coronavirus is less likely to spread outdoors,
especially when people wear masks and socially distance. But large
gatherings like the motorcycle rally also increase the number of
visitors inside restaurants and stores. A few businesses in Sturgis put
up signs limiting the number of customers who could enter, but most did
not post such notices.

Over the past week, there has been an
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/south-dakota-coronavirus-cases.html}{average
of 84 coronavirus cases per day} in South Dakota, a 31 percent increase
over the previous two weeks. At least four new virus deaths and 105 new
cases were reported on Thursday.

Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, encouraged people to attend the rally in
an interview on Fox News on Wednesday night, saying the state had
successfully hosted other large events --- including
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-mount-rushmore.html}{a
Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore} that President Trump
attended --- without seeing a direct increase in virus cases. Plus, she
said, the state's economy benefits when people visit.

The state's Department of Tourism has estimated that the annual festival
generates about \$800 million in revenue.

The rally, which has taken place every summer in Sturgis since 1938,
commenced amid strong objections from residents. In a city-sponsored
survey, more than 60 percent of the nearly 7,000 residents favored
postponing the event.

Little could be done to stop the event, said Doreen Allison Creed, the
Meade County commissioner who represents Sturgis. Ms. Creed said the
county lacked the authority to shut down the rally because much of it
takes place on state-licensed campgrounds.

When it became clear that it would go on as planned, the city said in a
\href{https://www.sturgis-sd.gov/media/Departments/Rally\%20\&\%20Events/2020\%20Sturgis\%20Motorcycle\%20Rally\%20Decision\%20pdf.pdf}{news
release} that changes would be made to safeguard residents from the
coronavirus, including adding hand-sanitizing stations to the downtown
area. The city plans to offer coronavirus testing for its residents once
the rally concludes on Aug. 16.

While the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
guidelines do not suggest a specific limit for the number of attendees
at gatherings or community events, they encourage organizers to maintain
a capacity conducive to reducing the spread of the virus. The agency
encourages people to socially distance at six feet apart and wear masks.

``Attendees will be asked to be respectful of the community concerns by
practicing social distancing and taking personal responsibility for
their health by following C.D.C. guidelines,'' the news release said.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some

But on Friday, throngs of ralliers parked their bikes and walked
shoulder to shoulder along the downtown streets, nary a mask in sight.
Police officers stationed at the intersections also were not wearing
masks.

Bruce Labsa, 66, drove from North Carolina last week to be among the
first in town. This was the first year he would be able to attend the
rally since retiring, and he did not want to miss it. On Friday, he was
not wearing a mask, and he said he had no concerns about catching the
coronavirus.

``I don't know anyone who's had it,'' Mr. Labsa said.

Amy Svoboda, 27, who was working in a women's apparel shop for bikers
called One Sexy Biker Chick, said Friday's crowd of shoppers had been
steady. She said she didn't know what to expect, but was happy to see
people turning out.

``We are allowed to make our own choices,'' she said. ``If we get it, we
chose to be here.''

Still, Nelson Horsley, 26, of Rapid City, S.D., said he expects there
will be a rise in coronavirus cases in the area once the rally concludes
next weekend. But he said he didn't feel the need to wear a mask while
walking around downtown Friday afternoon. He compared the virus to
getting the seasonal flu.

``I haven't seen anyone out here wear a mask so it kind of feels like it
defeats the purpose,'' he said, to wear a mask himself.

While most residents opposed the rally, some offered their front yards
as camp sites for bikers who were unable to find a hotel room. But many
others said they were worried about the impact the rally would
eventually have on the small community.

Among those was Patricia Viator, 64, who has lived in Sturgis for 16
years. She said she became resigned to the fact that there was nothing
residents could do to keep thousands of bikers from coming to the city.
She said she's worried for her family and the town, and she takes
several precautions when leaving her house, including wearing a mask.

``It scares me more than before because we don't have many cases around
here, but now this increases the chances of us locals getting it,'' she
said.
