With 60 million households still uncounted, the bureau said it would
wrap up the survey a month early. Critics called it a bald move to
politicize the count in favor of Republicans.

WASHINGTON --- The Census Bureau confirmed late Monday that it plans to
cut four weeks from the schedule for finishing its count of the nation's
330 million residents, a turnabout that census experts said would deeply
imperil an accurate tally of the population.

In a
\href{https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/delivering-complete-accurate-count.html}{statement
posted on its website}, the bureau said the updated schedule ``reflects
our continued commitment to conduct a complete count, provide accurate
apportionment data, and protect the health and safety of the public and
our work force.''

But the change is a retreat from the bureau's statement only months ago
that the pandemic
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/census-coronavirus-delay.html?searchResultPosition=12}{had
made it necessary} to ask for more time to complete the count on
schedule. And census experts have said that shortening the calendar for
the count would wreak havoc with efforts to reach the very
hardest-to-count households --- immigrants, minorities, young people and
others --- that have long been flagged as most likely to be missed in
this year's tally.

On Tuesday, four former directors of the Census Bureau issued a
statement warning that a shorter deadline ``will result in seriously
incomplete enumerations in many areas across our country,'' and urged
the administration to restore the lost weeks.

The directors, who served under both Democratic and Republican
presidents, also urged Congress to have a trusted body of experts
develop metrics to assess the quality of the bureau's population totals.
And they called on the census bureau ``to make transparency and openness
a priority'' to ensure outsiders that the count is being fairly and
honestly conducted.

Other critics, particularly Democrats and advocates for the poor and
minorities, called the change an unvarnished attempt by the Trump
administration to twist the nation's population count to exclude groups
that, by and large, tended to support Democrats.

Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York, the Democratic chairwoman of
the House Oversight committee that has jurisdiction over the census,
said the new schedule would ``rush and politicize the 2020 Census'' in
\href{https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2020-08-04.CBM\%20to\%20Dillingham\%20re\%20Transcribed\%20Interviews.pdf}{a
letter sent Tuesday} to Steven Dillingham, the Census Bureau director.

Ms. Maloney noted that Mr. Dillingham did not mention the schedule
change in testimony to the committee last week, and said she would
summon career Census Bureau experts to testify about the impact of the
change.

``This is a whole systemic attack on the census for political gain,''
Julie Menin, the census director for New York City, said in an
interview. ``There's an intentional attempt here to basically steal the
census --- to politicize this census to gain Republican seats across the
country.''

The bureau has offered no explanation for the change. But outside
experts said the explanation was clearly rooted in politics --- in
particular, in a demand by Mr. Trump last month
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/trump-immigrants-census-redistricting.html?searchResultPosition=5}{to
exclude undocumented immigrants} from the population totals that are
used every 10 years to reallocate House seats among the states.

Slammed by the pandemic, the Census Bureau had said earlier that it
wanted to delay its final delivery of population totals to the White
House until April 2021, rather than the statutory deadline of December
31. The speedup announced late Monday effectively rescinds that request
and assumes that the totals will be delivered by year's end --- before
any new president or Congress might take office.

That gives the White House its best opportunity to act on Mr. Trump's
effort to remove undocumented immigrants from the reapportionment
totals, assuming that a lawsuit challenging his directive fails. Many
legal experts said the president's demand for altered population totals
would violate the constitution, which calls for a count of all the
nation's residents.

The Census Bureau already has collected information from roughly 63
percent of the nation's households, all of which completed the 2020
survey online, by mail or by telephone. The schedule change announced
Monday primarily affects the count of some 60 million households that
have failed to fill out census forms, but it also compresses the time
left for tallying a number of other groups, including the homeless and
residents of group quarters like nursing homes and dormitories.

    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

All of those counts normally would be completed this month, and some of
them well before that. In mid-April, however, the Census Bureau said
that delays caused by the pandemic had forced it to extend the deadline
to October 31.

The latest
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/trump-census.html}{schedule
change} will move that deadline up by one month, to September 30. The
effect is to shorten to six weeks what had been a 10-week period
reserved for completing the count, so that the data can be compiled and
processed in time to deliver population totals by year's end.

Beyond reversing the bureau's request for a delay in April, the decision
to compress the schedule also effectively overrides recent public
statements by senior career employees at the Census Bureau that
delivering accurate population totals by December 31 would be
impossible.

``We can't do that anymore,'' the census official leading field
operations for the count, Tim Olson,
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6IyJMtDDgY\&feature=youtu.be\&t=4688}{told
a Native American organization} during a webinar in May. The associate
director of the census, Albert E. Fontenot Jr., echoed that last month,
saying ``we are past the window of being able to get those counts'' by
year's end.

The Census Bureau said in its announcement that it plans to mount ``a
robust field data collection operation'' to meet the new deadline, and
that it would be able to complete the 2020 census in a short time
``without sacrificing completeness.'' But beyond saying it would hire
more people and give its army of door-knockers awards for extra work, it
has offered few details of how it plans to meet the new goal.

Outside experts, including directors of past censuses, have said a
shortened count would inevitably fail to reach many of the hard-to-count
households in both inner cities and rural areas, and that the bureau
would be forced to use statistical techniques to make educated guesses
about who lived in them.

Serious inaccuracies would not only affect numbers used to reapportion
and redraw political districts, but also would skew the baseline that
will be used to allot trillions of dollars in federal grants and other
aid to the states until the next census in 2030.
