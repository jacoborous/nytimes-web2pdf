Delhi residents are stunned by how blue the sky really is as a strict
lockdown cuts back drastically on air pollution.

NEW DELHI --- There are countless downsides to the world's getting
walloped by the coronavirus and being put under severe lockdown.

But here in one of the most polluted cities on earth, where many people
routinely wear face masks to filter out the filth, something rare and
wonderful has emerged: a pure blue sky.

Because there are so few cars on the road, few factories belching out
black smoke and almost no active construction sites to create clouds of
choking dust, pollution levels in New Delhi, India's megalopolis
capital, have dropped to
\href{https://www.cpcb.nic.in/air/NCR/jantacurfew.pdf}{remarkably low
levels}.

At night there are stars. During the day the air is so clean that, for
once, you can't taste it, free of the usual smoky metallic tang. One
cruelty of the coronavirus is to be under a tight lockdown right now,
with parks bolted shut, ordered to stay indoors unless vitally
necessary, only to look out your windows and see this.

And the lockdown has spelled economic misery for the millions of people
who have been prevented from working.

But old-timers say Delhi's air hasn't been this clear for decades.

``I look at the sky quite often and enjoy its blueness from my
balcony,'' said Sudhir Kumar Bose, 80, a retired English professor.

``I don't know how long this will last,'' he added. ``But right now I
feel much better.''

It's not just Delhi, but Chennai, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Ghaziabad.
All across India, cities can suddenly breathe. Los Angeles, New York,
Beijing, Seoul and Milan ---
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/coronavirus-pollution.html}{they
have experienced less pollution}, too, hit hard by the virus and
restrictions on people's movement.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/world/08india-air-2/merlin_171367878_92275d43-02d0-4faa-82df-2611481f0a75-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

But those places aren't nearly as polluted as India. Nowhere is. Last
year, once again,
\href{https://www.iqair.com/world-most-polluted-cities}{India topped the
charts of the worst polluted} as home to 14 of the 20 cities with the
most hazardous air.

Delhi is among them, but last week it recorded a pollution reading of 38
on the Air Quality Index, about as good as anywhere in the world and
stunning to Delhiites who have become steeled to a reading of 150 AQI
--- on a good day.

Sometimes, especially in the winter, as cold air condenses car exhaust
and factory smoke and wind speeds drop, Delhi's AQI (which measures
different airborne pollutants) can shoot up to 500 or more. That gives
many people chronic coughs and more serious lung disease.

But now sick people are savoring the reprieve.

``My old patients say they can't believe it,'' said Dr. Arvind Kumar, a
Delhi chest surgeon who has been studying the consequences of living in
a place with bad air. ``They are feeling lighter, they are using their
inhalers less frequently, most of them are feeling better.''

Of course, everyone knows this is a sign of the frozen economy. The
clear skies are a consequence of a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html}{tight
lockdown} --- the world's biggest and one of the most severe --- that
has shuttered factories, grounded flights, evicted taxis, rickshaws and
crowded buses from the roads and brought movement to a screeching halt.
Many Indians are obeying the orders to stay indoors in a lockdown that
has become a national house arrest for a nation of 1.3 billion people.

Environmentalists are using these strange times to make a point. One of
the most outspoken, \href{https://nirvanabeing.com/why-us/}{Jai Dhar
Gupta}, an Ivy League-educated environmental activist and entrepreneur,
has been fighting for years against the widely held belief that India is
somehow doomed to suffer bad air because of its geography and climate.

``Clearly,'' he said, ``this is not something that can't be reversed.
We've just reversed it.''

Towns more than a hundred miles from the Himalayas

Punjab State. Others said the air was so clear
\href{https://twitter.com/deepscribble/status/1246773230422994945}{they
would soon be able to see God}.

The sky over Delhi is usually smudge gray, day or night. The gauze never
lifts. The sun sets mildly behind it.

Across much of China, too, air pollutants plunged after a lockdown to
stifle the epidemic closed factories, cut road traffic and drastically
reduced air travel.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

China's restrictions from January helped cut small, health-threatening
pollutants called PM 2.5 --- for being less than 2.5 micrometers in
diameter, the smallest and most dangerous particles that are monitored
--- by as much as 30 percent below normal levels, according to the
\href{https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/amid-coronavirus-outbreak-copernicus-monitors-reduction-particulate-matter-pm25-over-china}{Copernicus
Atmosphere Monitoring Service}. Levels of nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant
caused by motor vehicles and industry, also fell between 10 and 20
percent.

``This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such
a wide area for a specific event,'' said Fei Liu, an air quality
researcher at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,
\href{https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146362/airborne-nitrogen-dioxide-plummets-over-china}{according
to a report from NASA}.

But in China the near-pristine skies are already passing. There have
been \href{https://aqicn.org/city/beijing/cn/}{more bad days recently},
as factories have restarted and more vehicles have returned to the
roads.

In India, the lockdown is still in full effect, and it is unclear when
it will be lifted. Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, imposed the
strictures at the end of March, saying they would be for 21 days. But
many people fear he was just lowballing to keep the public from becoming
too dispirited.

Produce vendors in Delhi last month were hard up for business.

With some of the world's poorest, most densely packed slums, India has a
huge risk of a coronavirus crisis. Health officials are racing to
contain the highly contagious disease, which could rip through areas
where millions live face to face. With India's reported cases
\href{https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-india-covid-19-cases-doubling-every-4-days-set-to-touch-17-000-in-a-week-2207289}{doubling
around every four days} and now topping 4,000, many people are bracing
for a long lockdown.

At least there will be some dispensations.

There's almost no honking, no shouting, no jostling. Roads and public
spaces are wide open and empty, perfect to see --- and hear --- birds.
Delhiites are now

rare birds} like gray hornbills and red-throated flycatchers.

The other evening, after sunset, another rare delight showed itself:
Venus, shining crisp and bright and steady with nothing to obscure it.
The pure black sky was bursting with stars, wrapping around us, endless
but somehow consoling.
