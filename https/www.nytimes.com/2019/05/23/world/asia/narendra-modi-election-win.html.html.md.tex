NEW DELHI --- He called himself India's watchman, even as minorities
said they felt unsafe under his gaze. He boasted of his humble origins
while doing favors for billionaires. He spoke the language of business,
yet could not deliver enough jobs to Indians aspiring to a better life.

Despite those contradictions, Narendra Modi, India's incumbent prime
minister, led his party to a stunning election victory on Thursday,
eviscerating the opposition and giving Hindu nationalists the strongest
hand they have held in modern Indian history.

His mix of brawny Hindu nationalism, populist humility and grand
gestures for the poor --- like building tens of millions of new toilets
--- helped him become the first prime minister in nearly 50 years to win
a majority in successive parliamentary elections.

``This is the victory of the mother who was longing for a toilet,'' Mr.
Modi said in a speech to supporters on Thursday night. ``This victory is
of the farmers who sweat to fill the stomachs of others.''

\emph{{[}Here are}

takeaways from the victory for Narendra Modi and the BJP}}\emph{.{]}}

Many Indians see Mr. Modi, 68, as a nationalist icon. He
\href{https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/20170717-india-china-bhutan-border-dispute-doklam-beijing-siliguri-corridor-1022690-2017-07-07}{stood
up to China},
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-jets.html}{nearly
went to war with Pakistan} and
\href{https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/03/24/modi-s-three-foreign-policy-wins-pub-78675}{brought
India closer to the United States}. During the campaign, he described
himself as the \emph{chowkidar} --- the watchman. And many Indians felt
he was the best leader to raise India's standing in the world.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/25/world/23india2/merlin_155279835_22cef940-5083-4424-b404-8abe66520785-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

His success mirrors the rise of right-leaning populist figures around
the world. But detractors say his commitment to giving more power to the
country's Hindu majority has struck fear in the Muslim minority and is
pulling the country's delicate social fabric apart.

Under him,
\href{https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/02/18/violent-cow-protection-india/vigilante-groups-attack-minorities}{mob
lynchings} have shot up, Muslim representation in Parliament has dropped
to its lowest level in decades, and right-wing Hindus have felt
emboldened to push an extreme agenda, including lionizing the man who
fatally shot the independence hero Mohandas K. Gandhi.

Yet in Indian politics today, no other figure can approach Mr. Modi's
aura. Analysts call him ``larger than life'' and ``a cinematic
character.''

His Bharatiya Janata Party, by far India's richest and most aggressive,
has built a personality cult around him, and in speeches he refers to
himself in the third person.

``Are you happy that Modi kills by entering homes?'' he thundered at a
recent rally, recalling the airstrike he ordered on Pakistan in
February. ``Doesn't your chest puff out with pride?''

The crowd cheered.

``Modi has embedded himself in every Indian's consciousness,'' said
Arati Jerath, a prominent newspaper columnist.

In contrast, Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition Indian National
Congress party and the scion of a long political dynasty, is widely
perceived as inexperienced and weak. In acknowledging his defeat, Mr.
Gandhi said that the country was engaged in a long ideological battle,
and ``love never loses.''

The election turnout was one for the history books --- the largest
democratic exercise ever. From April 11 to May 19, more than 600 million
Indians cast ballots at a million polling stations from high in the
Himalayas to the tropical islands in the Andaman Sea.

Intense feelings about Mr. Modi, for or against, helped drive turnout to
67 percent, the highest ever.

Even some voters who were worried about the economy or did not like the
way Mr. Modi had stirred communal divisions said they still saw him as
the best leader for India now.

``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/20/world/asia/india-election-modi-farmers.html}{Farmers
are in trouble},'' said Vinay Tyagi, a wheat and sugar cane farmer in
the swing state of Uttar Pradesh. ``But we still voted for the B.J.P.
because there was no alternative for us. The other candidates weren't
good.''

To keep his job, Mr. Modi campaigned relentlessly, holding 142 rallies
and covering 65,000 miles. On the night before voting ended,
\href{https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1130040024953569281}{he
meditated in a Himalayan cave} in the same area where, more than 50
years earlier, he had wandered as a young man searching for purpose.

Mr. Modi will be the first two-time prime minister ever to come from a
lower caste. He grew up poor in a small town north of Ahmedabad, in the
state of Gujarat. This has been a powerful part of his narrative: He
calls himself a lowly \emph{chaiwalla}, a tea-seller, a clear jab at
India's elite.

At age 8, he became part of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a
right-wing Hindu group that would play a huge role in his life. Its
members are the foot soldiers of the Hindu nationalist movement, and
some critics have accused it of embracing fascism --- in the 1930s, the
group's members were inspired by Mussolini's Italy.

In school, Mr. Modi was known as an average student, but he demonstrated
a talent for theater and debating.

When he was around 18, he went on his Himalayan sojourn, contemplating a
life as an ascetic priest.
\href{https://www.indiatoday.in/trending-news/story/narendra-modi-humans-of-bombay-interview-part-2-1427633-2019-01-10}{In
a recent interview}, he said that he had bathed in freezing rivers, hung
around holy men and learned to ``align himself with the rhythm of the
universe.''

He also deserted the young woman whom his parents had arranged for him
to marry. Even now it is unclear whether Mr. Modi ever lived with her.

In his 20s and 30s, he was a preacher for the R.S.S., and then a worker
for the B.J.P. in Gujarat, where he oversaw the printing of banned
pamphlets pushing Hindutva, the belief in the primacy of the Hindu
religion and way of life. Analysts say he remains an
``ultranationalist'' at his core.

``He is very divisive,'' said Ms. Jerath, the newspaper columnist. ``He
believes in the politics of polarization: us against them, Hindus
against Muslims, rich against poor, poor against rich.''

A pivotal event came in February 2002, when Gujarat exploded in
religious riots. Mr. Modi, then chief minister of the state, was blamed
for not stopping the bloodshed, which left more than 1,000 people dead,
most of them Muslim.

From then on, Mr. Modi would be known among the Hindu right as a hero.
Many Muslims considered him a killer.

But in the next few years, Mr. Modi sought to cultivate a different
reputation. He became a friend of free enterprise and helped attract
thousands of manufacturing jobs to Gujarat.

Business people and middle-class voters began to rally around him,
seeing him as someone who could get results. At the same time, the
dynastic Congress party, which led India for most of its history since
independence from Britain, was collapsing, plagued by scandals and the
absence of an inspiring leader.

In 2014, the first time Mr. Modi ran for prime minister, he emphasized
infrastructure, development and rooting out corruption. His B.J.P. won a
landslide, and Congress suffered its biggest defeat --- winning only 44
seats out of 543, the party's worst showing in its 100-year-plus
history.

Once in office, Mr. Modi swiftly consolidated power, making big
decisions within a small circle of advisers.

He quickly announced several high-profile social programs, including the
building of 100 million new toilets, a goal his government has nearly
reached. Many voters in this election cited the toilets --- and the
dignity they brought --- as one reason for giving him their vote.

But there were also troubling signs. Hindu nationalists, encouraged by
the election of one of their own to the country's highest office, began
persecuting and even killing Muslims and low-caste Hindus.

Mr. Modi and his party appointed Hindu nationalists to key posts at
universities and government agencies. They changed place names from
Muslim to Hindu and rewrote children's history books, purging entire
sections on Muslim rulers.

In November 2016, Mr. Modi suddenly
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/world/asia/modi-cash-ban-india.html}{invalidated
most of the nation's currency} in the name of fighting corruption. The
move made it nearly impossible to use cash in a country that relied on
it for everything.

Seven months later, the government
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/world/asia/india-tax-narendra-modi.html}{replaced
a complex set of state taxes with a single national goods and services
tax}. While most economists say it was a sensible reform, the new system
was so complicated that it caused chaos at millions of small businesses.

The twin blows battered the economy and paralyzed job growth in a
country where five million young people enter the work force every year.
He was also criticized for signing a multibillion-dollar fighter jet
deal with France that sent part of the work to an Indian billionaire
with no experience.

Still, supporters say that Mr. Modi
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/business/india-modi-business-red-tape.html}{cut
bureaucracy for businesses}, invested in major infrastructure like roads
and tried to tackle some of India's biggest problems, such as a lack of
health care for the poor.

As the campaign began, many analysts predicted that Mr. Modi would lose
support over India's economic challenges.

Everything changed on Feb. 14, when a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/world/asia/pulwama-attack-kashmir.html}{suicide
bomber blew up a bus of paramilitary forces in Pulwama} in the state of
Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan claim. Jingoism surged, and so
did Mr. Modi's approval ratings. He campaigned hard on national
security, and voters seemed to respond.

``The scale of the win is remarkable,'' said Menaka Guruswamy, a senior
lawyer in India's Supreme Court and lecturer at Columbia Law School.

But she added: ``I don't know of a word that begins to capture how
deeply divided we are at this point.''
