There have been at least 1,803,600 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in
India, according to the \href{https://www.mohfw.gov.in/}{Ministry of
Health and Welfare}. As of Monday morning, 38,135 people had died.

India is one of many developing nations where leaders feel they have no
choice but to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/world/asia/reopening-before-coronavirus-ends.html}{prioritize
reopenings and accept the risks of surging coronavirus infections.} Yet
its public health system is severely strained, and experts believe it is
likely to reach a breaking point as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's
government continues to ease a nationwide lockdown.

Initially, the country took some of the strictest measures anywhere to
slow the spread of the coronavirus, including placing all 1.3 billion
citizens under a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html}{nationwide
lockdown}. But the measures were brutally hard on the poorest Indians.
Some of the restrictions were lifted in early May to help revive the
economy, including allowing construction and plantation work to resume
and many shops to reopen.

When Mr. Modi announced the lockdown, hundreds of thousands of migrant
workers were initially stranded in cities without a way to reach their
home villages. Some started long journeys on foot. Most headed back to
the countryside because they couldn't afford the rent or food without
work in the cities, and that just spread the virus across the larger
swaths of the country.

The New York Times has found that official
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-death-toll-total.html}{tallies
in the United States} and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html}{in
more than a dozen other countries} have undercounted deaths during the
coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.

India's lockdown was largely considered effective, and it was widely
obeyed. But with the measures largely lifted, anxiety is rising as the
caseload surges, and more people have complained that they have been
unable to find hospital beds.

India's total caseload has become the world's third-largest. So far, a
large chunk of India's Covid-19 cases have come from five states:
Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, followed by Delhi, Karnataka and Andhra
Pradesh.

Public health experts have warned that the country's testing figures
were still far too restricted. But capacity has been rising: On July 9,
more than 267,000 samples were tested in 24 hours, taking the total
number of samples tested so far to 10,740,832.

\hypertarget{about-the-data}{%
\subsection{About the data}\label{about-the-data}}

\textbf{Confirmed cases and deaths} are counts of individuals whose
coronavirus infections were confirmed by a laboratory test.
\textbf{Probable cases and deaths} count individuals who did not have a
confirmed test but were evaluated using criteria developed by national
and local governments. Some governments are reporting only confirmed
cases, while others are reporting both confirmed and probable numbers.
And there is also another set of governments that are reporting the two
types of numbers combined without providing a way to separate the
confirmed from the probable. The Times is now using the total of
confirmed and probable counts when they are available individually or
combined. Otherwise only the confirmed count will be shown.

Governments often revise data or report a large increase in cases on a
single day without historical revisions, which can cause an irregular
pattern in the daily reported figures. The Times is excluding these
anomalies from seven-day averages when possible.

Keep your distance from others. Stay at least six feet away from people
outside your household as much as possible.

Wash your hands often. Anytime you come in contact with a surface
outside your home, scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds, rinse and
then dry your hands with a clean towel.

Avoid touching your face. The virus primarily spreads when contaminated
hands touch our nose or mouth or eyes. Try to keep your hands away from
your face unless you have just recently washed them.

Wear a mask outside your home. A mask protects others from any potential
infection from you. The more people who wear masks, the more we all stay
safer.
