There have been at least 116,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus in
Canada, according to the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/canada/canada-coronavirus-cases.html}{Public
Health Agency}. As of Sunday morning, at least 8,941 people had died.

About this data For total cases and deaths: The map shows the known
locations of coronavirus cases by region. Circles are sized by the
number of people there who have tested positive or have a probable case
of the virus, which may differ from where they contracted the illness.

Here's how the number of cases and deaths are growing in Canada:

Canada's first known case of coronavirus appeared on Jan. 25. A man who
had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, China tested positive for the virus.
His wife tested positive a day later.

Quebec soon became the province most severely affected, likely because
its winter school break, which saw many families travel to the southern
United States and other warm weather destinations, occurred two weeks
before provincial lockdown measures began to sweep the country in
mid-March.

On March 21, Canada closed its border with the United States, with
exceptions for freight movements and some essential workers. It was the
first time the entire border had been shut since Canada became a nation
in 1867.

For the most part, the handling of the virus outbreak has not become a
partisan or politicized issue and politicians have generally deferred to
public health officials about how to handle it. While some provinces
began easing some restrictions in early May, Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has repeatedly said that a substantial relaxation remains at
least weeks and possibly months away.

\hypertarget{about-the-data}{%
\subsection{About the data}\label{about-the-data}}

\textbf{Confirmed cases and deaths} are counts of individuals whose
coronavirus infections were confirmed by a laboratory test.
\textbf{Probable cases and deaths} count individuals who did not have a
confirmed test but were evaluated using criteria developed by national
and local governments. Some governments are reporting only confirmed
cases, while others are reporting both confirmed and probable numbers.
And there is also another set of governments that are reporting the two
types of numbers combined without providing a way to separate the
confirmed from the probable. The Times is now using the total of
confirmed and probable counts when they are available individually or
combined. Otherwise only the confirmed count will be shown.

Governments often revise data or report a large increase in cases on a
single day without historical revisions, which can cause an irregular
pattern in the daily reported figures. The Times is excluding these
anomalies from seven-day averages when possible.

Experts'
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-profile-covid.html}{understanding
of how the Covid-19 works is growing.} It seems that there are
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html}{four
factors that most likely play a role}: how close you get to an infected
person; how long you are near that person; whether that person expels
viral droplets on or near you; and how much you touch your face
afterwards.
