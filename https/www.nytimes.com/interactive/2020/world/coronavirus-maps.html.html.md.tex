The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/prepare-for-coronavirus.html}{coronavirus
pandemic} has sickened more than 17,824,000 people, according to
official counts. As of Sunday morning, at least 685,100 people have
died, and the virus has been detected in nearly every country, as these
maps show.

About this data The map shows where the average number of reported cases
over the past two weeks is increasing, decreasing or about the same.
Countries with an increase in the rate of cases are shaded darker.
Countries with fewer than 100 cases over the past two weeks are not
shaded. Data for the West Bank and Gaza was reported together by the
Palestinian Health Ministry and includes only Palestinian-controlled
land. Russia is reporting data for Crimea, a peninsula it
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/world/europe/ukraine.html}{annexed
in 2014} in a move that led to international sanctions. Data for some
countries, like the United States and France, include counts for
overseas territories. Japan's count includes 696 cases and seven deaths
from a cruise ship that docked in Yokohama.

The coronavirus pandemic is ebbing in some of the countries that were
hit hard early on, but the number of new cases is growing faster than
ever worldwide, with more than 200,000 reported each day on average.

We have updated the charts in the table below to show weekly cases per
capita to better reveal when new hot spots emerged and receded. The
charts were previously showing the rate of change in cases.

Show all

Weekly cases per capita shows the share of population with a new
reported case for each week. Weeks without a reported case are shaded
gray.

Almost twice as many countries have reported a significant rise in new
cases over the past two weeks as have reported significant declines,
according to a New York Times database.

Note: Countries are grouped according to how the seven-day average of
new cases has changed from two weeks ago to today. Countries with fewer
than 100 cases are not shown.

The outbreak was initially defined by a series of shifting epicenters
--- including Wuhan, China; Iran; northern Italy; Spain; and New York.

Cases worldwide leveled off in April after social distancing measures
were put in place in many of the areas with early outbreaks.

But as countries began to reopen in May and June, the United States was
unable to contain a resurgence of the disease, making it one of the main
drivers of rising case numbers around the world.

On average, the United States now accounts for about a quarter of all
new cases reported worldwide every day.

\hypertarget{united-states}{%
\subsection{United States}\label{united-states}}

The number of known coronavirus cases in the United States continues to
grow quickly. As of Sunday morning, at least 4,628,400 people across
every state, plus Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories, have
tested positive for the virus, according to a New York Times database,
and at least 154,900 patients with the virus have died.

See our
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{page
of maps, charts and tables} tracking every coronavirus case in the U.S.

After case numbers fell steadily in April and May,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{cases
in the United States} are growing again at about the same rapid pace as
when infections were exploding in New York City in late March. But the
hotspots are now mainly spread across the southern and western parts of
the country.

The New York Times is engaged in an effort to track the details of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{every
reported case in the United States}, collecting information from
federal, state and local officials around the clock. The numbers in this
article are being updated several times a day based on the latest
information our journalists are gathering from around the country. The
Times has
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-county-data-us.html?action=click\&module=Spotlight\&pgtype=Homepage}{made
that data public} in hopes of helping researchers and policymakers as
they seek to slow the pandemic and prevent future ones.

\hypertarget{about-the-data}{%
\subsection{About the data}\label{about-the-data}}

In data for the United States, The Times is now including cases and
deaths that have been identified by public health officials as probable
coronavirus patients. Some states and counties only report figures in
which a coronavirus infection was confirmed through testing. Because
confirmed cases are widely considered to be an undercount of the true
toll, some state and local governments have started identifying probable
cases and deaths using criteria that were developed by states and the
federal government.

\textbf{Confirmed cases and deaths} are counts of individuals whose
coronavirus infections were confirmed by a laboratory test.
\textbf{Probable cases and deaths} count individuals who did not have a
confirmed test but were evaluated using criteria developed by national
and local governments. Some governments are reporting only confirmed
cases, while others are reporting both confirmed and probable numbers.
And there is also another set of governments that are reporting the two
types of numbers combined without providing a way to separate the
confirmed from the probable. The Times is now using the total of
confirmed and probable counts when they are available individually or
combined. Otherwise only the confirmed count will be shown.

Governments often revise data or report a large increase in cases on a
single day without historical revisions, which can cause an irregular
pattern in the daily reported figures. The Times is excluding these
anomalies from seven-day averages when possible.

coronavirus cases in the United States from The New York Times

Experts'
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-profile-covid.html}{understanding
of how the Covid-19 works is growing.} It seems that there are
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html}{four
factors that most likely play a role}: how close you get to an infected
person; how long you are near that person; whether that person expels
viral droplets on or near you; and how much you touch your face
afterwards.

You can help reduce your risk and do your part to protect others by
following some
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/prepare-for-coronavirus.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&module=styln-coronavirus\&variant=show®ion=TOP_BANNER\&context=storyline_menu\#link-56871453}{basic
steps}:

Keep your distance from others. Stay at least six feet away from people
outside your household as much as possible.

Wash your hands often. Anytime you come in contact with a surface
outside your home, scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds, rinse and
then dry your hands with a clean towel.

Avoid touching your face. The virus primarily spreads when contaminated
hands touch our nose or mouth or eyes. Try to keep your hands away from
your face unless you have just recently washed them.

Wear a mask outside your home. A mask protects others from any potential
infection from you. The more people who wear masks, the more we all stay
safer.

Here's a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html}{complete
guide on how you can prepare} for the coronavirus outbreak.
