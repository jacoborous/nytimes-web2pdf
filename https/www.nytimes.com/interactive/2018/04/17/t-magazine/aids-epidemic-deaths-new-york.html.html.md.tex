\section{Those We Lost to the AIDS
Epidemic}\label{those-we-lost-to-the-aids-epidemic}}

The AIDS epidemic was (and still is, in some communities) a catastrophe
no one predicted. Throughout the 1980s in New York City, there was
little government support for those who contracted the virus --- a
symptom of the era's discrimination against minorities, intravenous drug
users and gay people. Ignorance about or shame associated with what was
called the ``gay plague'' was prevalent. Given the high rate with which
gay men died, certain fields of enormous creativity and change --- from
art to fashion to literature --- were devastated, never to recover
completely. (Among women, African-American women were, and still are,
disproportionately affected.) Herewith, a memorial to some of those the
culture lost forever to H.I.V./AIDS-related causes.
