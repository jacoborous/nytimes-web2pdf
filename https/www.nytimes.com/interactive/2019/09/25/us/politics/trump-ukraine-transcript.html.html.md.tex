MEMORANDUM OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION

(S/NF) The President: Congratulations on a great victory. We all watched
from the United States and you did a terrific job. The way you came from
behind, somebody who wasn't given much of a chance, and you ended up
winning easily. It's a fantastic achievement. Congratulations.

(S/NF) President Zelenskyy: You are absolutely right Mr. President. We
did win big and we worked hard for this. We worked a lot but I would
like to confess to you that I had an opportunity to learn from you. We
used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as
an example for our elections and yes it is true that these were unique
elections. We were in a unique situation that we were able to

achieve a unique success. I'm able to tell you the following; the first
time, you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential
election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won
the parliamentary election. I think I should run more often so you can
call me more often and we can talk over the phone more often.

(S/NF) The President: {[}laughter{]} That's a very good idea. I think
your country is very happy about that.

(S/NF) President Zelenskyy: Well yes, to tell you the truth, we are
trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our
country. We brought in many many new people. Not the old politicians,
not the typical politicians, because we want to have a new format and a
new type of government. You are a great teacher for us and in that.

(S/NF) The President: Well it's very nice of you to say that. \textbf{I
will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a
lot of time.}1 Much more than the European countries are doing and they
should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing
for you. All they do is talk and I think it's something that you should
really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks
Ukraine, but she doesn't do anything. A lot of the European countries
are the same way so I think it's something you want to look at
\textbf{but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I
wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are
happening that are not good but the United States has been very very
good to Ukraine.}2

(S/NF) President Zelenskyy: Yes you are absolutely right. Not only.
100\%, but actually 1000\% and I can tell you the following; I did talk
to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her. I also met and talked with
Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they
need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not
enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should
work for Ukraine. It turns out that even though logically, the European
Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is
a much bigger partner than the European Union and I'm very grateful to
you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine.
Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about
sanctions against the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you
for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue
to cooperate for the next steps. specifically we are almost ready to buy
more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.

  1 Mr. Trump alludes to American aid, while not explicitly linking his
  request to unfreezing it. At the time of this call, Mr. Trump was
  holding back hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance to
  Ukraine that Congress had appropriated to help that country fend off
  Russian aggression.
\item
  2 Mr. Trump brings up the idea of reciprocity, suggesting that the
  United States has been good to Ukraine even though something Ukraine
  has done is not good. The next thing Mr. Trump said --- after Mr.
  Zelensky responded to this statement --- was to ask for
  investigations.

(S/NF) The President: \textbf{I would like you to do us a favor though
because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about
it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation
with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your
wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot
of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding
yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney
General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the
bottom of it.}3 As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a
very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent
performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you
can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.

(S/NF) President Zelenskyy: Yes it is very important for me and
everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it is
very important and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready
to open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United States
and Ukraine. For that. purpose, I just recalled our ambassador from
United States and he will be replaced by a very competent and very
experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two
nations are getting closer. I would also like and hope to see him having
your trust and your confidence and have personal relations with you so
we can cooperate even more so. I will personally tell you that one of my
assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very
much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will
meet once he comes to Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once again
that you have nobody but friends around us. I will make sure that I
surround myself with the best and most experienced people. I also wanted
to tell you that we are friends. We are great friends and you Mr.
President have, friends in our country so we can continue our strategic
partnership. I also plan to surround myself with great people and in
addition to that investigation, I guarantee as the President of Ukraine
that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly. That I can
assure you.

(S/NF) The President: Good because I heard you had a prosecutor who was
very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people
are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down
and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly
respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I
would like him to

  3 Mr. Trump said Attorney General William P. Barr would call the
  Ukrainian president about another investigation. Mr. Trump appears to
  be referencing an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory pushed by Rudolph
  W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, that Ukraine had some
  involvement in the emails stolen from Democratic National Committee.

  In testimony after the White House released this reconstructed
  transcript, an official on the call told impeachment investigators
  that the ellipses represented important words or phrases that were
  deliberately left out. Among the omissions was Mr. Trump raising the
  existence of recordings of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.,
  and Mr. Zelensky's mentioning Burisma Holdings, the energy company
  whose board employed Mr. Biden's son Hunter.

  4 Mr. Trump is pushing Mr. Zelensky to deal directly with Mr.
  Giuliani, his personal lawyer and close ally. Mr. Giuliani has
  repeatedly pushed conspiracy theories about the Bidens and encouraged
  the Ukrainian government to ramp up investigations into them.
\item
  5 Here, Mr. Trump pushes the Ukrainian president to get his country's
  prosecutor to open an investigation into former Vice President Joseph
  R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter.
\item
  6 Mr. Zelensky promises to do what Mr. Trump is asking --- launch an
  investigation into the Bidens --- but also asks Mr. Trump if he can
  provide any information for Ukrainian investigators to look at.

Note: The words released by the White House recounting Mr. Trump's
conversation with Mr. Zelensky look like a transcript, but the document
is marked, Memorandum of Telephone Conversation, and it warns that it is
not a verbatim account. Instead, it was ``developed with assistance from
voice recognition software along with experts and note takers
listening.''
