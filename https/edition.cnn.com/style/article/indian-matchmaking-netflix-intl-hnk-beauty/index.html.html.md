On Netflix's "Indian Matchmaking," marriage consultant Sima Taparia
travels the world to meet with hopeful clients and help them find the
perfect match for an arranged marriage.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

The format of the show is simple. Hopeful brides- and grooms-to-be meet
with Taparia -- often with their overbearing parents in tow -- for an
initial consultation. Criteria are laid out, potential suitors are
presented on paper, dates are arranged, and then it's up to the couple
to decide if it's **** a match.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

In some respects, the producers should be commended. This is a show that
turns away from the ["big fat Indian
wedding"](https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/india-wedding-culture/index.html)
trope and offers something fresh: a look at how some traditional-facing
couples meet through the services of a professional matchmaker.

The characters' stories -- as well as cringier moments -- play out in
entertaining ways, at times revealing the absurdities and awkwardness of
matchmaking. I laughed when, for example, **** Taparia sought the
consultation of an astrologist and a face reader.

At other points, the show presents brutal truths about Indian culture:
the emphasis on being "fair"; the enormous pressure to wed; the focus on
caste and class; the stigmatization of independent, working women.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

But the show fails to contextualize or even question these problematic
beliefs when they're brought up by its characters, presenting them
instead as the status quo.

</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

With that,
[Netflix](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/20/entertainment/indian-matchmaking-netflix/index.html)
missed an opportunity to challenge a social system fraught with cultural
biases, and also educate a global audience on important nuances. In Sima
Taparia, the show found a regressive anchor who merely peddles flawed
practices.

### Colorism

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">

Mentioned casually but frequently throughout the eight episodes is the
idea that candidates should be "fair," or in other words, have light

This cultural bias is engrained from an early age, with women bearing
more of the societal pressure to have lighter skin. If you're a woman,
darker skin can be a deal-breaker for families seeking the perfect wife
for their son. For men, fair skin is seen as a bonus but not as much of
a requirement.

Colorism and the desirability of "fairness" is drilled into young girls.
In my own case, it started when I was in middle school in India, when my

for me and my future marriage prospects.

"Indian Matchmaking" **** itself offers a window into the lifestyles of

Perhaps this makes it easier for families to avoid explicitly specifying
fair skin as part of their match criteria. Taparia assumes it goes
without saying, and constantly describes women as a "good person" or
match because they are "fair and good looking." Some of the families
rely on this -- it allows them to be politically correct and vague in
their search for someone "good looking" without explicitly saying
"fair."

Yet, they get exactly the kind of complexion they want to see. It's the
equivalent of writing "caste no bar" in a matrimonial ad -- a suggestion
that the person who placed the ad is willing to consider candidates
regardless of social hierarchy -- but in reality only going on dates
with people from the "community," which becomes a euphemistic catch-all
term for people from the same religion, caste or class.
