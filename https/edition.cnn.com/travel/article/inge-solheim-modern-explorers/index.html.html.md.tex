(CNN) --- Should you ever encounter a polar bear in the wild, Norwegian
explorer Inge Solheim has some advice.

Step one: Make a lot of noise. "I'm banging kettles ... I'm shouting and
trying to scare it off," he told CNN. If it persists, step two: Use
pepper spray or a flare gun. Aim the flare gun in front of the animal
-\/- you don't want the flare sailing over the bear's head and exploding
behind it, he explains. Retreating is the next option if there's a
viable exit. The absolute "last resort," in the event of an attack, is
using live ammunition.

Solheim, who's been visiting the North Pole for the past 20 years, knows
his place in the icy wilderness' natural order. "It's their home; they
belong there, I don't," he says. "I have to do everything I can not to
disturb a polar bear and try not to put myself in a situation where I
have to kill one."

He adds that, despite the dangers polar bears pose, statistically, the
biggest risks he faces in the Arctic is carbon monoxide poisoning or a
tent fire related to the gasoline stoves used for cooking. But so far so
good for Solheim.

Raised in the village of Otta in central Norway, Solheim was never apart
from nature. "I grew up with stories about the old explorers: (Fridtjof)
Nansen, (Roald) Amundsen, (Ernest) Shackleton, (Otto) Sverdrup," he
says. "They were rock stars back in the day."

A childhood in the mountains was traded for a career in finance, before
Solheim quit for the call of the wild. He went on to become a much
sought-after guide, leading injured soldiers in the
\href{https://walkingwiththewounded.org.uk/Home/About/63}{Walking With
The Wounded} expeditions to the North Pole in 2011 and South Pole in
2013, along with Prince Harry.

The pull of the North Pole has remained a constant, with 20 expeditions
so far. "It sounds stupid, probably, but because it's the hardest and
most hostile place, it's also the most rewarding place for me," he
explains. "I feel that the North Pole brings out the best in me."

"I think the lessons you learn out here and the confidence you build is
much deeper and more solid than what you can learn in the office life or
private life at home," he adds. "Out here you're stripped down to the
basic of what it is to be human."

Yet, despite his achievements, he's reluctant to be labeled an explorer.
"I never felt comfortable in those shoes," says Solheim, comparing his
exploits to the early polar pioneers. "What these guys did was so far
beyond what I can do today."

Solheim in northern Norway last winter. The explorer swam in frigid
waters with Humpback whales and Orcas as part of an awareness-raising
campaign.

In homage to his forebears' superhuman feats, Solheim has followed in
their footsteps. In 2005, he took part in a recreation of the race
between Britain's R. F. Scott and Norway's Amundsen to the South Pole in
1911 (Greenland stood in for Antarctica as dogs are now prohibited from
the continent, over
\href{https://www.bas.ac.uk/about/antarctica/environmental-protection/wildlife-and-plants-2/removal-of-the-sledge-dogs/}{concerns
that they could introduce diseases to seals, or disturb wildlife}). For
three months he donned period gear, used period equipment and ate period
rations for the 2,500-kilometer race. Solheim says his hefty caribou
hide sleeping bag was the best he's ever used. As in real life, the
Norwegian team won.

The times are changing in the Arctic; even pollution is finding its way
into
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/15/world/microplastics-arctic-snow-alps-study-scr-trnd/index.html}{the
remotest corners of the world}.

"We are polluting and we're spoiling our self and ruining the world
around us," Solheim told CNN on a guiding trip to the Svalbard
archipelago. "I think going out here and experiencing the beauty, and
feeling at one with nature, I think it reminds us that we have to
protect it."

Solheim's attempt to reach the North Pole this year was thwarted. A
700-kilometer solo speed ski from Siberia to the pole would have made
him the first person to trek from land to the North Pole
\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AxP_1zx2JJWlcrEOZyAcAq0ohWHr_4Lg2uMpVD6DeWw/edit\#gid=0}{since
2014}. But the attempt was put on ice when he didn't receive permission
to depart from a Russian military zone.

Still, there's always next year, and Solheim already has a date penciled
in the diary: March 15, 2020. "I'm working on funding, and with the
right authorities in Russia, so unless they decide to have some military
exercise again at the same place, I'm optimistic," he told CNN.

"I think it will be the hardest expedition I've ever done -\/- and also
the most rewarding because of that."
