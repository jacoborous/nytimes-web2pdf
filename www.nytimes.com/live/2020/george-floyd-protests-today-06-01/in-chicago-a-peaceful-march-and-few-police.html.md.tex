In contrast to the mayhem in Midtown Manhattan, Brooklyn was a different
world tonight.

Thousands of peaceful protesters marched on Eastern Parkway and down
Flatbush Avenue. Organizers were self-policing and working with law
enforcement to keep the routes clear and the marchers safe.

I might have missed it, but I didn't see or hear of any arrests or even
confrontations.

Even after the curfew took effect at 11 p.m., the police were lined up
in front of stores along Flatbush Ave. but made no attempts to engage
the protesters who hadn't gone home.

When it was over and I was walking home on an empty Myrtle Ave., a bus
driver stood outside his bus.

``You at the protests tonight? I was the guy honking!'' He was beaming.
He held up a video on his phone of the march I'd just left. ``I like
this,'' he said, smiling down at it. ``I like this right here.''

As the sun set on an extraordinary day of civil unrest across America,
the mayor of Birmingham, Ala., ordered the removal of a contentious
Confederate statue from a public park.

One day after dozens of protesters targeted the statue, the 115-year-old
\href{https://www.al.com/news/2020/06/the-history-of-birmingham-monuments-damaged-during-george-floyd-protest.html}{Confederate
Soldiers \& Sailors Monument} in Linn Park, defacing and chipping away
at its base, the mayor said it would be removed. A large crane arrived
shortly before 8 p.m., in the final hours of Jefferson Davis Day, the
state holiday in Alabama honoring the Confederate leader.

The statue has been at the center of a legal fight between the city and
the state's attorney general's office, with the city wanting it removed
but ultimately losing the battle. Still, Randall Woodfin, the mayor of
the majority black city, approved the removal on Monday in defiance of
the Alabama Monuments Preservation Act, setting the stage for another
showdown.

Hundreds of Chicagoans joined a march that zigzagged for miles
throughout the North Side, passing Wrigley Field and eventually taking
over Lake Shore Drive.

As they chanted George Floyd's name, the protesters were cheered on by
people who dangled signs out of their windows in a show of support.
Chicago police stayed mostly out of sight, guiding the crowd down empty
streets but keeping a low profile.

A citywide curfew beginning at 9 p.m. remained in effect as Chicago
officials tried to contain disorder and looting that has occurred for
several days.

Many demonstrators had heard of the vow by President Trump earlier
Monday to deploy the military if necessary.

``It's upsetting to see our president make threats against people
exercising their First Amendment rights,'' said Will Rogosin, 20, a
student at DePaul University. ``If we can't protest peacefully, what can
we do?''

``It doesn't solve anything,'' saidi Farai Madondo, 20, also a student.
``You're not giving us any options.''

The driver of an S.U.V. barreled through a line of law enforcement
officers in riot gear in Buffalo, injuring two of them in a
confrontation that was caught on video, authorities said.

One of those injured was a Buffalo police officer and the other was a
member of the New York State Police, according to Mark Poloncarz, the
Erie County executive, who, along with a spokesman for the mayor, said
that both officers were in stable condition. The driver and the
passengers in the S.U.V. were taken into custody, Poloncarz wrote on
Twitter.

About 10:15 p.m., 15 minutes after curfew, a peaceful crowd gathered at
the Minneapolis site where George Floyd was killed began running toward
flashing lights in the distance, saying that they won't back down from
the police.

They barricaded all of the streets around the site to keep the police
away. Now they are all back in an intersection just waiting for what
comes next.

Police officers from Arlington County, Va., were told to immediately
leave Washington after law enforcement officers fired canisters of tear
gas into a crowd of peaceful protesters so that President Trump could
walk to a nearby church and be photographed holding a bible, according
to the Arlington County Board.

Arlington police had been deployed to Washington as part of a mutual aid
agreement with the Secret Service, the Park Police, Washington
Metropolitan Police, the National Guard and others.

``At the direction of the County Board, County Manager and Police Chief,
all A.C.P.D. officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 tonight,''
the county said in a statement. ``The County is re-evaluating the
agreements that allowed our officers to be put in a compromising
position that endangered their health and safety, and that of the people
around them, for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.''

``Appalled mutual aid agreement abused to endanger their and others
safety for a photo op,'' Libby Garvey, a county board member, said on
Twitter.

While large peaceful protests happened earlier in the night in Astoria,
Queens, in Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, Midtown Manhattan has been hit
by a rash of looting and smashed shop windows.

A Coach store on 44th Street was cleaned out. The front door was
completely smashed. Shelves were empty. ``They did it so fast,'' said
one police officer as she entered.

``Great job, guys,'' deadpanned another as a group of officers
approached.

A couple blocks north, between 46th and 47th, an AT\&T store was also
cleaned out. Two young black men sat in handcuffs in front of the store
amid specks of glass. Officers milled around outside, chatting in
stupefaction. One snapped a photo of the scene with his smartphone.

Democratic political leaders wasted no time in condemning President
Trump's photo op at St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, for which
hundreds of peaceful protesters were cleared out with tear gas.

In a tweet, Joe Biden, Trump's rival in November's election, attacked
the president for ``using the American military against the American
people'' in order to set up a photo for himself.

Hillary Clinton characterized the situation as ``a horrifying use of
presidential power against our own citizens.

\begin{quote}
Tonight the President of the United States used the American military to
shoot peaceful protestors with rubber bullets \& tear gas them.

For a photo op.

This is a horrifying use of presidential power against our own citizens,
\& has no place anywhere, let alone in America. Vote.

Jenkins cautioned that if protesters left the property to march into
downtown, where the 7 p.m. curfew remains in effect, that they will
likely be arrested by Dallas Police.

``I support peaceful protest and radical transformation,'' he said.

As scores of protesters made their way into Washington D.C's Chinatown
district, a Lakota helicopter with U.S. Army markings descended to
rooftop level, kicking up dirt, debris and snapping trees that narrowly
missed several people. The maneuver, often conducted by low flying jets
in combat zones to scare away insurgents, is known as a show of force.

In this case it was successful. The crowd quickly dispersed into
surrounding blocks, and minutes later the helicopters returned for
another pass.

At dusk in Los Angeles, a massive gathering marched down Hollywood and
Sunset Boulevards. Law enforcement gave the group a wide berth and
things also seemed peaceful.

But as the 6 p.m. curfew took effect, groups peeled off, targeting the
Gower Gulch shopping complex, smashing windows of the Kabob Daddy
restaurant, ripping plywood off of a T-Mobile store and a Rite-Aid.

Then the frenzy began, with men and women in masks, some carrying
skateboards, others documenting the events on smartphones, moving in and
out of the stores with items under their arms. Officers quickly
descended on the scene en masse as the majority of the mob fled, many in
vehicles, indicating coordination.

Outside the 7th Precinct building in New York, a group of roughly 1,000
protesters gathered as two dozen police with batons and helmets stood
behind a metal barricade. The crowd proceeded to take a knee.

Police officers have a large group of protesters cordoned off in front
of Radio City Music Hall. A prisoner transport bus has just arrived, and
arrests seem likely. I've seen a few officers with their badges/numbers
covered up with surgical masks.

The police and protesters have crowded the streets in Washington and
President Trump was seen walking from the White House to St. John's
Church, which was damaged during the protests on Sunday.
