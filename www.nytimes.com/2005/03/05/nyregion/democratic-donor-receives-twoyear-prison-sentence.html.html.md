NEWARK, March 4 - Charles Kushner, a multimillionaire real estate
executive, philanthropist and one of the top Democratic donors in the
country, was sentenced on Friday to two years in federal prison after
pleading guilty to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and
making illegal campaign donations.

Mr. Kushner, 50, built a construction business begun by his father into
a private real estate empire that owned more than 25,000 apartments,
millions of square feet of commercial and industrial space and thousands
of acres of developable land.

But Mr. Kushner also became embroiled in a bitter family feud over the
business and how proceeds were distributed. That dispute, plus his
growing prominence as a political financier, helped lead to his
downfall. The intrafamily acrimony was such that Mr. Kushner retaliated
against his brother-in-law, who was cooperating with federal
authorities, by hiring a prostitute to seduce him. He then arranged to
have a secretly recorded videotape of the encounter sent to his sister,
the man's wife.

The two-year sentence was the most Mr. Kushner could have received under
a plea agreement, reached last September with the United States
attorney, Christopher J. Christie, that called for 18 to 24 months in
prison. But it was less than the sentence of nearly three years that Mr.
Christie had sought in recent weeks after concluding that Mr. Kushner
had failed to show "acceptance of responsibility" for his crimes as
required by the plea deal.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Details of that heated fight between prosecutors and Mr. Kushner's
lawyers were unveiled in more than two and a half hours of argument on
Friday before Judge Jose L. Linares in Federal District Court.

In the end, the judge rejected the prosecution's argument but said he
was nevertheless left with the difficult task of weighing the "horrific"
nature of Mr. Kushner's acts against his sister and brother-in-law
versus his many philanthropic acts in determining whether leniency was
warranted.

"It is difficult for me to reconcile the generous man with the
revengeful, hateful man," Judge Linares said. "But I must take into
consideration the vengeful nature in which this was done. In light of
all the relevant circumstances, I find that you be imprisoned for 24
months."

Mr. Kushner, dressed in a navy blue suit, white shirt and polka-dot tie,
told the judge that while he did not believe he was as saintly as his
lawyers and the letters sent to the judge on his behalf would suggest,
neither was he as evil as the prosecution portrayed him. He nonetheless
acknowledged that "the actions which bring me before you today were
disgraceful and reprehensible."

Mr. Kushner, who will continue to be free on $5 million bail, was
ordered to surrender on May 9 to begin serving his sentence at a federal
prison at a military base in Montgomery, Ala. He was also ordered to pay
a $40,000 fine.

After the sentencing, Mr. Christie said he was pleased. "It shows that
no matter how rich and powerful you are in this state you will be
prosecuted and punished for crimes you commit," he said. "This sends a
strong message that when you commit the vile and heinous acts that he
has committed you will be caught and punished."

Benjamin Brafman, Mr. Kushner's lead lawyer, said that while he was
pleased that Judge Linares did not throw out the original plea deal's
sentencing recommendations, he was "angry and disappointed" that the
judge chose not to sentence his client to 18 months in prison.

"It disappoints me because I thought that after years of being one of
the kindest and giving persons, it would matter in this state," Mr.
Brafman said. "It does matter in other states, but apparently it doesn't
mean anything in this state."

Mr. Kushner's lawyers provided Judge Linares with about 700 letters
praising Mr. Kushner's charity and philanthropy, among them letters from
people who had benefited from Mr. Kushner's acts, including
schoolchildren and the sick.

While Mr. Christie said that his investigation into Mr. Kushner's
campaign contributions was continuing, the sentencing on Friday capped a
rapid-fire series of events last summer in which Mr. Kushner, a major
contributor to Gov. James E. McGreevey, was arrested, followed a week
later by Mr. McGreevey's resignation after admitting to an adulterous
homosexual affair.

The arrest of a businessman who was so close to Mr. McGreevey had fueled
speculation that the governor, already besieged by federal
investigations of his campaigns, aides and other associates, was himself
on the brink of political destruction at best and federal charges at
worst.

Mr. Kushner had put the man with whom Mr. McGreevey's aides said the
governor had the affair, Golan Cipel, an Israeli citizen, on his payroll
for a time. He also helped Mr. Cipel to get the United States work
permits that allowed Mr. McGreevey to appoint him to a top
counterterrorism post that he was later forced to quit.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. McGreevey appointed Mr. Kushner to the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey and nominated him to become its chairman, but Mr. Kushner
quit after complaints were raised that his contributions to New Jersey
Democrats may have violated campaign-finance and conflict-of-interest
laws.

In seeking the longer prison term, an assistant United States attorney,
Scott Resnick, told Judge Linares that Mr. Kushner had failed to comply
with subpoenas for business documents and had not presented sufficient
proof that all the videotapes made of his brother-in-law and the
prostitute had been turned over or destroyed.

Rather than seeing these things as Mr. Kushner's "failure to accept
responsibility," Judge Linares faulted the prosecution for not securing
stronger guarantees for compliance, and he accepted Mr. Kushner's
assurance in court and in affidavits that the videotapes had been
destroyed.
