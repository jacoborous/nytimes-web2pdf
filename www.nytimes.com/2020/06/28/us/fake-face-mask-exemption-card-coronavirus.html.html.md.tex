Fake}\label{mask-exemption-cards-from-the-freedom-to-breathe-agency-theyre-fake}}

The group, which is selling the cards online, is not a real government
organization, federal officials said.

Cards for sale that claim to exempt people from wearing masks during the
coronavirus pandemic are fraudulent, federal officials said.

The cards --- featuring a red, white and blue eagle logo and
approximately the size of a business card --- say the bearer is exempt
from ordinances requiring them to wear masks in public.

``Wearing a face mask posses a mental and/or physical risk to me. Under
the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), I am not required to disclose
my condition to you,'' reads the card, which misspells ``poses'' and
incorrectly names the Americans with Disabilities Act.

There's also a warning that businesses or organizations can be reported
to the Freedom to Breathe Agency, the group behind the cards. One
version of the cards featured the Justice Department's logo and listed a
legitimate phone number where complaints about violations of the
Americans with Disabilities Act can be submitted.

The cards were being sold online in boxes of at least 500 for \$49.99.

But such cards and fliers
\href{https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdnc/pr/covid-19-alert-fraudulent-facemask-flyers}{were
not issued or endorsed} by the Justice Department, federal officials
said.

``Do not be fooled by the chicanery and misappropriation of the DOJ
eagle,'' said Matthew G.T. Martin, the United States attorney for the
Middle District of North Carolina. ``These cards do not carry the force
of law. The `Freedom to Breathe Agency,' or `FTBA,' is not a government
agency.''

Mr. Martin's statement mentioned nothing about charges arising from the
cards, and the group distributing them said no legal action had been
taken against it.

The cards were created in response to complaints, the group's
communication team said in an email, and as ``an educational tool'' to
help people ``understand their legal and human rights so they can stand
up to the unlawful, unscientific and unconstitutional mandates.''

The communications team declined to provide a named spokesperson, citing
concerns over ``the safety of our key members.'' The group said it had
received hundreds of reports and continued to get them daily from people
who did not want to wear masks and because of that had been ``denied
access, discriminated, degraded, intimated and coerced.''

``These are people who have medical conditions where wearing a face mask
puts them at significant health risk,'' the group added.

The

for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing cloth face

The founder of the Freedom to Breathe Agency, Lenka Koloma, advertised
the cards on her Facebook page, and they were sold on a site created
through the commerce platform Shopify. The site was unavailable on
Sunday afternoon.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

``Shopify takes concerns around the goods and services made available by
merchants on our platform very seriously,'' a company spokeswoman,
Sheryl So, said. ``We have multiple teams who handle potential
violations of \href{https://www.shopify.com/legal/aup}{Shopify's
Acceptable Use Policy}, including malicious and deceptive practices.''

The original Facebook group and a website on the Wix platform for the
Freedom to Breathe Agency were also taken down. Facebook and Wix could
not immediately be reached on Sunday.

The group behind the cards said it had requested support and information
from Wix and that it had experienced ``unlawful and unconstitutional
censorship by Facebook.''

Facebook on Wednesday said it planned to
