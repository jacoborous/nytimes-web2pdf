Dispute Over
Safety}\label{trump-will-give-convention-speech-in-jacksonville-capping-a-dispute-over-safety}}

The move from Charlotte, N.C., where the Republican convention was
originally planned, came after the president demanded to hold an event
without social distancing rules.

\emph{{[}\textbf{\textbf{Update}}:}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/jacksonville-rnc.html}{\emph{Trump
abruptly cancels Republican Convention in Jacksonville}}\emph{.{]}}

WASHINGTON --- It's official: President
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/rnc-masks-convention.html}{Trump}
will deliver his Aug. 27 convention speech in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/rnc-masks-convention.html}{Jacksonville},
Fla., inside an arena that holds 15,000 people, after his demands for an
event without social distancing rules led to a rift with Democratic
leaders in North Carolina, where the Republican convention was
originally planned.

Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee,
confirmed on Thursday that the speech would take place at the VyStar
Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, a diverse city where the mayor
and the governor are both Republican allies of Mr. Trump's. An R.N.C.
official would not say what, if any, coronavirus safety precautions
would be put in place.

``Not only does Florida hold a special place in President Trump's heart
as his home state, but it is crucial in the path to victory in 2020,''
Ms. McDaniel said in a statement. ``We look forward to bringing this
great celebration and economic boon to the Sunshine State in just a few
short months.''

The event for Mr. Trump in Jacksonville, not in Charlotte, N.C., as
planned, coincides with one of the darkest days in the city's history.
The president will address his supporters on the 60th anniversary of
``Ax Handle Saturday,'' when a white mob organized by the Ku Klux Klan
attacked mostly black civil rights protesters sitting at the city's
whites-only lunch counters. The attackers hid ax handles in the brush at
Hemming Park, said Alan Bliss, the executive director of the
Jacksonville Historical Society.

The city's white mayor at the time, Haydon Burns, suppressed news about
the beatings, Dr. Bliss said, and it was not until 2001 that the day was
commemorated with a marker, paid for by the historical society, at the
park. The current mayor, Lenny Curry, a Republican, removed a bronze
Confederate soldier statue from the same park this week.

It was not clear that the historical resonance of the date for the city,
which is about 30 percent African-American, was known to Republican
officials before its selection.

Republican officials on Friday declined to say whether they were aware
of the significance of the date for the city of Jacksonville ahead of
its selection. Paris Dennard, an R.N.C adviser for black media affairs,
said about the anniversary of ``Ax Handle Saturday,'' While we cannot
erase some of the darkest moments of our nation's past, we can denounce
them, learn from them, fight for justice and a more perfect union for
every American.''

The announcement of the Jacksonville speech capped a furious scramble
set off after Mr. Trump and Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a
Democrat, reached a stalemate over how to pull off the convention as
originally planned in Charlotte. Mr. Cooper insisted on social
distancing measures and masks inside to protect attendees from the
spreading of the coronavirus. Mr. Trump rejected those measures out of
hand, insisting on a packed indoor arena with the look and feel of a
country that had returned to business as usual despite the continuing
health crisis.

Jacksonville, roughly a six-hour drive from Charlotte, was seen as the
top contender as Republican officials considered a range of last-minute
replacements. Former Vice President
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.}, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is leading Mr. Trump
in Florida by about three percentage points, according to polls. And Mr.
Trump, who
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/trump-new-york-florida-primary-residence.html}{changed
his residence} from New York to Florida last year, is uniquely focused
on winning his adopted home state, which he won by a slim margin four
years ago.

One of the holdups on any official announcement earlier this week was a
question about whether Jacksonville had enough hotel rooms to
accommodate the gathering. Some of the hotel rooms that will be used for
the swarm of delegates, party officials, national news teams and other
attendees will be as far as 20 miles from the venue, according to people
involved in the planning.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

On Thursday, Republican officials were careful not to refer to the
events that will take place in Jacksonville as a convention. Instead,
they referred to it as the city chosen ``to celebrate the renomination
of President Donald J. Trump.'' The official business of the convention,
they said, would still be held in Charlotte.

Ms. McDaniel also blamed Mr. Cooper for the change of plans, saying that
``the current North Carolina Covid-19 restrictions would not allow for
the celebration to occur in Charlotte, and Governor Cooper would not
work with the R.N.C. to offer guidelines.''

In a statement, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a Republican who had
campaigned for the convention to be moved to his state, said that
``Jacksonville is a great city that will showcase Florida's energy,
facilities, entrepreneurship and commitment to bring together the
delegates of the Republican Party at a historic time in our nation's
history.''

Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Patricia Mazzei
