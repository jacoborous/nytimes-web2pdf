Confinement}\label{paul-manafort-trumps-ex-campaign-manager-released-to-home-confinement}}

Paul Manafort, who had been serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence in
Pennsylvania for fraud, is among the prisoners released over the
spreading coronavirus.

WASHINGTON --- Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign
chairman, was released from prison on Wednesday and granted confinement
in his home in Northern Virginia because of the coronavirus pandemic,
said one of his lawyers, Todd Blanche.

Mr. Manafort had been in a minimum-security prison in Loretto, Pa.,
serving a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/us/politics/paul-manafort-sentencing.html}{sentence
of seven and a half years} for financial and lobbying violations related
to his work for a corrupt Ukrainian politician.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/us/coronavirus-prisons-jails.html}{Prisons
and jails across the country} have been hot spots for the spread of the
virus, though there were no recorded cases among inmates or staff at the
facility where Mr. Manafort was held.

Attorney General William P. Barr
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/politics/barr-coronavirus-prisons-release.html}{ordered
the Bureau of Prisons} in April to determine which federal inmates could
be safely released to home confinement. He directed the bureau to ``give
priority in implementing these new standards to the most vulnerable
inmates and the most affected facilities.'' More than 2,500 inmates have
been released to home confinement because of the virus since late March,
according to Bureau of Prisons data.

In mid-April,
\href{https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000171-76cd-d6b1-a3f1-f6dd06590000}{Mr.
Manafort's lawyers asked the bureau} to release their client to home
confinement. The lawyers said he was at high risk of contracting the
virus because of his age, 71, and pre-existing health conditions. Also,
he was hospitalized in February after contracting the flu and
bronchitis.

A person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to speak
publicly about it said the Bureau of Prisons decided to release Mr.
Manafort to home confinement because of his underlying health
conditions, even though he did not meet a time-served threshold. The
person said the bureau had the discretion to make these decisions.

The charges against Mr. Manafort
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/us/politics/manafort-trump-campaign-data-kilimnik.html}{stemmed
from the investigation by the special counsel}, Robert S. Mueller III,
into possible ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign, but the
cases did not involve his five months of political work for Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/nyregion/michael-cohen-release-prison-otisville-virus.html}{Michael
D. Cohen}, had also been told last month that he would be released to
home confinement because of virus concerns. He had been expected to be
home by May 1, but he remains in quarantine in a medium-security prison
in Otisville, N.Y., said a person familiar with his situation. Another
person familiar with Mr. Cohen's incarceration said he would be eligible
to be released to home confinement when he has served half of his
sentence, which will be this month.

Mr. Cohen has been serving three years for violating campaign finance
laws in part related to a scheme to pay hush money to two women who said
they had affairs with Mr. Trump. The president has denied the affairs
and publicly criticized Mr. Cohen, who once said he would
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/us/politics/trump-michael-cohen.html}{take
a bullet for Mr. Trump}.

Some inmates and staff at the Otisville prison have tested positive for
the coronavirus and have since recovered, but it has not been as
widespread there as it has been at other detention centers.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

Mr. Trump has publicly praised Mr. Manafort. After Mr. Manafort was
convicted, the president said his former campaign chairman
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1032256443985084417}{``refused
to `break'''} under pressure from prosecutors, unlike Mr. Cohen.

``I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family,'' Mr.
Trump said at the time. ``Such respect for a brave man!''

Last June, Mr. Manafort was to be transferred to the Rikers Island jail
complex in New York City to await
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/nyregion/manafort-indictment.html}{state
mortgage fraud charges}, as is typically done with most federal inmates
in that position. But the Justice Department, which oversees the Bureau
of Prisons,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/nyregion/manafort-rikers.html?searchResultPosition=6}{intervened}to
ensure that Mr. Manafort would not be moved from the low-security
facility in Pennsylvania.

Mr. Manafort was indicted in New York as part of an effort by the
Manhattan district attorney to ensure he would face time in prison, even
if Mr. Trump pardoned him for his federal crimes.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/nyregion/paul-manafort-ny-fraud-charges.html}{In
December, a judge dismissed} the state charges.

Haberman and William K. Rashbaum from New York.
