Twitter can't tell us whether, or how,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/biden-sanders-debate-recap.html}{Sunday's
debate} between
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.} and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html}{Bernie
Sanders} might change voters' minds. But it can give us the perspectives
of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign
strategists, consultants and analysts.

Here is a sampling of their reactions, both to the candidates' overall
performances and to their exchanges on key topics.

\subsection{Joe Biden}\label{joe-biden}}

Mr. Biden's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joe-biden-female-vice-president.html}{commitment
to choose a woman as his running mate} earned him praise, as did his
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007035872/biden-pandemic.html}{responses
to questions about the coronavirus}. But he also had some shakier
moments, and some strategists thought that given his solid lead in the
primary, he should have focused more on contrasting himself with
President Trump than with Mr. Sanders.

\begin{quote}
``.@joebiden is looking very good here. Strong. Command. Rising to the
moment of crisis. Best he's been in 11 debates.'' ---

academic debates.'' ---

``Joe Biden's answer to the question on how he will get the support of
Latinx voters, who have overwhelmingly voted for Sanders, was
inadequate. Was it me or did it sound like he didn't care that Latinx
voters aren't voting for him?'' ---

``Biden has been surprisingly negative, given current polls \& delegates
\& fact that coronavirus news is likely to overwhelm the debate \& the
primary. I expected more of a pivot to the general \& more Trump
attacks.'' ---

\hypertarget{bernie-sanders}{%
\subsection{Bernie Sanders}\label{bernie-sanders}}

Commentators thought Mr. Sanders, too, had a strong performance over
all, but they did not think he changed the course of the race, which has
veered sharply toward Mr. Biden. He also drew some criticism for his
continued defense of his
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/us/bernie-sanders-fidel-castro-florida.html}{controversial
remarks about Fidel Castro}.

\begin{quote}
``Bernie Sanders had the better \#DemDebate performance tonight, but
@JoeBiden won the debate by committing to a woman VP. The Democratic
primary is over.'' ---

``On climate, there are a lot of people --- especially young people ---
who simply want to hear @JoeBiden say that it is an existential threat
and would be a sacred mission for his administration. @BernieSanders
speaks in moral imperatives, and Biden responds in a programmatic way.''

\hypertarget{coronavirus}{%
\subsection{Coronavirus}\label{coronavirus}}

The first and most important subject Sunday night was the coronavirus
pandemic, which has
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html}{killed
thousands of people worldwide} and, in the past week,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/coronavirus-usa}{shut down much
of American society}. The candidates took different approaches: Mr.
Biden emphasized his experience responding to the swine flu and Ebola
outbreaks during the Obama administration, while Mr. Sanders argued that
the pandemic proved the need for programs like ``Medicare for all.''

\begin{quote}
``Sanders with a more coherent initial response on COVID-19 than Biden
--- and meets Dem voters where they are by criticizing the president's
response as insufficient.'' ---
\textbf{\href{https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1239342811578802176}{Dave
Wasserman}}, editor at Cook Political Report

``People might get tired of hearing about the Ebola example, but the
learned lessons from experience is critical to save lives --- especially
if we are dealing with something worse.'' ---

for all{]} message to \#coronavirus. A really good contextualization of
how he will govern.'' ---
\textbf{\href{https://twitter.com/JessLivMo/status/1239348017288839175}{Jess
Morales Rocketto}}, political director of the National Domestic Workers
Alliance

``This entire debate so far has really been a series of questions about
crisis management, through the prism of coronavirus. In short, Biden's
answer is leadership. Sanders' answer is ideology.'' ---

\hypertarget{running-mates}{%
\subsection{Running mates}\label{running-mates}}

The most unexpected news of the debate came when Mr. Biden pledged
unequivocally to choose a woman as his running mate if he wins the
nomination.

Asked if he would make the same pledge, Mr. Sanders said he would
probably choose a woman but did not commit definitively the way Mr.
Biden had, saying instead that he would ``in all likelihood'' do so and
that ``my very strong tendency is to move in that direction.''

\begin{quote}
``My 7yr-old daughter just charged into the room: @JoeBiden just
declared that his running mate will be a woman! Did you hear that?!''
---
\textbf{\href{https://twitter.com/MariaTeresa1/status/1239358896071942144}{María
Teresa Kumar}}, president of Voto Latino

``Biden commits to a woman VP on the stage. That was crucial and
welcome. Bernie is offered the chance to commit and refuses to do the
same. Why.'' ---
\textbf{\href{https://twitter.com/SLThomas/status/1239358370299117569}{Shaunna
Thomas}}, co-founder and executive director of UltraViolet

``Only news out of tonight's debate is that @JoeBiden committed to
picking a woman as VP and @BernieSanders did not.'' ---

``The question itself implies there is a qualified woman who meets your
standards out there. Hedging says you think there might not be. That's
the problem with Bernie's answer.'' ---
