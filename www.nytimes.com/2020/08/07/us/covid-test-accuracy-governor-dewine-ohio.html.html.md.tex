Positives and
Negatives}\label{how-accurate-are-virus-tests-ohio-governors-results-show-positives-and-negatives}}

With testing delays nationwide, experts are increasingly recommending a
new type of rapid test that gives less accurate results. It is
imperfect, but as one expert put it, ``pretty good is a lot better than
none.''

Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio received a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/us/mike-dewine-coronavirus.html}{negative
coronavirus test result} on Thursday, hours after a positive test result
had stopped him from meeting with President Trump in Cleveland. The
contradictory results during a high-profile moment underscored the
challenges of testing, an issue that has repeatedly stymied the virus
response in the United States.

``I'm sure the internet is lighting up with, `Well, you can't believe
any test,''' Mr. DeWine, a Republican, said
\href{https://www.iheart.com/podcast/433-woody-the-wake-up-call-28200119/episode/governor-mike-dewine-talks-about-his-69800541/?autoplay=true}{during
an interview with 92.3 WCOL}, a Columbus radio station, on Friday.

``No one should take the results of this test and say, `Oh, none of
these numbers are right,''' he added. ``There is always a possibility
for error.''

At issue are two types of coronavirus tests that are increasingly taking
center stage as part of the virus response in the United States. As part
of a screening by the White House, Mr. DeWine first received an antigen
test, a newer type of test that provides faster results but is less
accurate than traditional laboratory testing. He was later tested using
a more standard procedure known as polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R.,
an accurate but time-intensive method that requires samples to be
processed at a laboratory.

Widespread, fast testing is the cornerstone of any virus response and an
area where the United States has consistently fallen short. In order to
ramp up testing to a level needed to stop the spread of the virus,
experts are increasingly recommending a strategy that casts a wide net
with
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/health/rapid-Covid-tests.html}{widespread
adoption of faster, less accurate tests}. But that comes with drawbacks.

To better understand the difference between the two types of tests and
the accuracy of testing overall, we spoke with Dr. Bill Miller, an
epidemiologist at the Ohio State University.

\hypertarget{what-is-the-difference-between-a-pcr-test-and-an-antigen-test}{%
\subsection{What is the difference between a P.C.R. test and an antigen
test?}\label{what-is-the-difference-between-a-pcr-test-and-an-antigen-test}}

A P.C.R. test is the test that is probably most familiar to Americans.
It involves taking a swab from a person's nose and sending the sample to
a laboratory to process.

The approach amplifies a sequence of nucleic acids in order to detect
tiny amounts of the virus. Because the process amplifies the sequence,
the test is highly accurate, but the results can take hours or days to
process. ``It allows you to get very high sensitivity, meaning most
people who have the virus who have a P.C.R. test are going to get
identified,'' Dr. Miller said.

But there have been problems with access to the tests. As cases spiked,
the demand overwhelmed laboratories, and shortages in the supply chain
meant many Americans had to wait days --- or even weeks --- for results.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/virus-testing-delays.html}{The
delays render the tests largely useless}. Experts say results are needed
within 24 to 48 hours to effectively quarantine and contact trace. In
the United States, turnaround times are often stretching three to five
days, or more.

Antigen tests look for a protein that is a part of the virus. They can
also be done using a nasal swab, but can provide
\href{https://www.bd.com/en-us/offerings/capabilities/microbiology-solutions/point-of-care-testing/bd-veritor-sars-cov-2}{faster,
easy-to-decipher results}, similar to a pregnancy test.

Antigen tests can provide results in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html}{less
than an hour.} But because the process does not amplify particles, Dr.
Miller said ``the ability to detect the virus is lower by definition.''

\hypertarget{how-accurate-are-the-results}{%
\subsection{How accurate are the
results?}\label{how-accurate-are-the-results}}

All virus tests have the possibility of an inaccurate result. ``It is
just a fact of clinical testing,'' said Dr. Miller, who recommended
using common sense about the risk of exposure when evaluating unexpected
results.

But antigen tests are generally less sensitive and less accurate than
the traditional nasal swab, laboratory test. Interestingly, antigen
tests are more likely to produce false negatives --- missing someone who
has the virus --- than false positives, the opposite of what appears to
have happened to Mr. DeWine.

Mr. DeWine is expected to be tested again on Saturday.

States are increasingly turning to antigen tests as part of a strategy
to ramp up testing. Mr. DeWine is part of a bipartisan group of
governors --- four Republicans and four Democrats --- who are
negotiating to purchase the tests from two medical companies, Becton,
Dickinson \& Company and the Quidel Corporation. The companies were the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html}{first
to receive emergency authorization} for antigen tests from the Food and
Drug Administration, but the tests could produce false negative results
between 15 and 20 percent of the time.

\hypertarget{if-the-results-are-not-always-accurate-why-are-experts-pushing-for-more-rapid-testing}{%
\subsection{If the results are not always accurate, why are experts
pushing for more rapid
testing?}\label{if-the-results-are-not-always-accurate-why-are-experts-pushing-for-more-rapid-testing}}

The United States is currently testing at a daily rate of 241 tests per
100,000 people,
\href{https://globalepidemics.org/july-6-2020-state-testing-targets/}{according
to an estimate by Harvard Global Health Institute}. By the same
estimate, the country would need 355 tests per 100,000 people to slow
the spread of the virus, and more than 1,000 tests per 100,000 people to
truly suppress the virus by detecting and responding to outbreaks as
they occur.

To ramp up enough testing, experts say the United States cannot rely on
traditional one-by-one laboratory tests alone.

Antigen tests offer one strategy that could prove useful for crowded
settings like nursing homes or schools. ``You have the advantage of
being able to quickly identify people who might be infected and getting
them isolated and separated,'' Dr. Miller said. ``Whereas where you have
to wait 48 or 72 hours for a test result to come back, you have that
window of time where people are often not fully isolated or
quarantined.''

In short, there are societal benefits to casting a wide net with faster,
less accurate tests, but it can cause confusion on a personal level, as
the DeWine case seems to show.

Speaking from his home in Cedarville, Ohio, on Friday, Mr. DeWine said
it had been ``quite a big shock'' to be told that he had tested
positive. He recalled that after receiving the news, he and his wife,
Fran, came back home. ``Fran fixed me some chicken and rice soup,'' he
said. ``She thought we were settled in for the long haul here.''

But by Thursday evening, he had received better news.

``The antigen tests do give us a cheap way to do a lot of tests that are
pretty good,'' Dr. Miller said. ``Pretty good is a lot better than none,
and it collectively gets us a lot closer to the goal of being able to
isolate and quarantine people when they need to be.''
