Amitabh Bachchan, whose face is everywhere in the country, checked into
a hospital with mild symptoms. His son, daughter-in-law and
granddaughter have also become infected.

NEW DELHI --- When this country's biggest film star, Amitabh Bachchan,
announced Saturday night that he had contracted the coronavirus, a loud
alarm bell rang across India.

Mr. Bachchan, known as Big B, is not simply an enormously successful
actor. He is one of India's most revered figures. His face and rich,
avuncular voice, dripping with gravitas, are everywhere, deployed in ads
for household products, voice-overs at museums and countless public
service campaigns. He was recently roped into doing a campaign on ---
what else? --- the coronavirus.

The worry was that if Big B could catch the virus, anybody could, and
with India getting walloped by Covid-19, Mr. Bachchan, 77,
\href{https://twitter.com/SrBachchan/status/1282002456063295490}{said on
Twitter on Saturday}: ``All that have been in close proximity to me in
the last 10 days are requested to please get themselves tested!''

India is now racking up more new reported infections each day --- about
30,000 --- than any other country except the United States and Brazil
--- and it is rapidly catching up to Brazil. India now has the
third-highest total cases after the United States and Brazil.

The authorities in several big Indian cities and states are reinstating
quarantines after attempting to loosen things up to stimulate a
critically wounded economy. The borders between states are again being
rigorously patrolled, with visitors shunted off to isolation centers.

International travel is still blocked. Hospitals are overflowing with
the sick. Even emergencies are being turned away.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/world/asia/coronavirus-india-hospitals-pregnant.html}{One
pregnant woman was left to die} in the back of an ambulance a few weeks
ago after being rejected from eight hospitals in 15 hours.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/12/world/12amitabh3/merlin_174481251_77be7f4a-d053-407d-9d2a-cbce3b839113-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been trying to lift spirits by saying
in televised speeches that India is still doing better than richer
countries, especially when it comes to the death rate. India has
reported about 16 coronavirus-related deaths per million people, while
the United States, Brazil, Spain and Italy have all lost hundreds per
million.

Experts think this might be for a few reasons. India's average age,
around 28, is younger than that of other countries. Obesity is less
prevalent, too, and many doctors believe that obesity creates a greater
vulnerability to the coronavirus. Some medical professionals also
believe that Indians have strong immune systems because of
\href{http://www.pharmabiz.com/NewsDetails.aspx?aid=126323\&sid=1}{their
constant exposure to microbes}, living in cities that are not as clean
as cities in the West.

Another explanation, though, might simply be testing --- or the lack of
it. India has performed far fewer coronavirus tests per capita than many
other countries have.

Either way, the Indian authorities keep coming up with innovative ways
to fight the virus. At airports, for instance, video cameras have been
installed that enable security officers to check passengers' boarding
passes remotely to minimize face-to-face contact. The officers who use
electromagnetic wands to screen passengers now use wands attached to
four-foot rubber poles to maintain distance. And many Indians, even the
poorest, have been wearing face masks for months.

India's biggest enemy is the density of its population. This country has
dozens of cities with more than a million people. Even in smaller towns
and villages, many families live in cramped quarters, eight or even 10
people to a room, which makes a highly contagious illness like the
coronavirus very hard to stop.

In many of these areas, it is impossible to maintain social distancing.
In recent weeks, Mumbai, one of India's most-packed cities and home to
Mr. Bachchan, the movie star, has especially struggled.

The virus started out in Mumbai's wealthier neighborhoods among the
jet-setter crowd. Then it
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/world/asia/mumbai-lockdown-coronavirus.html}{swept
through the slums}. Now it is gnawing through the entire city, home to
20 million.

On Saturday night,
\href{https://twitter.com/SrBachchan/status/1282002456063295490}{Mr.
Bachchan announced via Twitter} --- where he has 43.2 million followers
--- that he had tested positive. He was soon admitted to Nanavati
Hospital, near the exclusive Juhu neighborhood in Mumbai where he lives,
overlooking the Arabian Sea.

It appears that several of his family members have fallen sick as well.

His son, Abhishek Bachchan, also an actor, disclosed that he had
contracted the coronavirus. Abhishek's wife, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, an
actress and model, tested positive, as did their 8-year-old daughter,
Aaradhya.

All seemed to have mild symptoms, officials said.

The illness in the illustrious Bachchan clan was such big news that the
health minister of Maharashtra State issued a Twitter post about it at
4:30 a.m. Sunday.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

It is hard to overstate how big Big B really is. Walk through just about
any city in India, and there is his handsome, gray-bearded face staring
down from a billboard or a railway bridge, advertising a new phone app
or chocolate bar or public health campaign.

The son of a renowned poet, Mr. Bachchan is celebrated for his mastery
of language and diction. He has acted in more than 200 films over the
past 50 years --- and he is still working and drawing admirers. Until
the coronavirus lockdown brought life to a screeching halt this spring,
thousands of fans would camp out in front of his Mumbai mansion nearly
every Sunday, hoping to get a glimpse of him. Mr. Bachchan would step
out from his gates for a few minutes and stand on a stool and graciously
wave.

``He's like god,'' said Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, a filmmaker who has
worked with Mr. Bachchan. ``I've never seen a star having such power,
such credibility. He's the biggest superstar this country has ever, ever
seen.''

Part of Mr. Bachchan's appeal, Mr. Dungarpur said, was that, for half a
century, Mr. Bachchan has carefully chosen roles where he is fighting
against all odds, taking on the system, getting justice for the common
man. He is also very civically minded and has helped out with many
real-life causes.

Mr. Dungarpur, who runs a
\href{https://filmheritagefoundation.co.in/}{film preservation
foundation} to save heritage films across South Asia, said Mr. Bachchan
had helped him immensely, serving as the foundation's brand ambassador.

His contracting of the coronavirus might create more fear across India.
But it could also help take away some of the stigma that infected
Indians have endured, evidenced by people kicked out of their
neighborhoods and a
\href{https://www.livemint.com/news/india/illness-triggers-social-stigma-and-suicide-in-southern-tamil-nadu-11586884992752.html}{few
even driven to suicide}.

Mr. Dungarpur predicted that a lot of Indians would find his struggle
inspiring and say to themselves, ``If Amitabh Bachchan can fight this,
so can we.''
