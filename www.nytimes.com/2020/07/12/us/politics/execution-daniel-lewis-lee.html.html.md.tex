Daniel Lewis Lee is set to be put to death after an appeals panel
rejected a suit from his victims' family members, who said the
coronavirus prevented them from traveling to the execution.

WASHINGTON --- The first federal inmate in 17 years is set to be put to
death on Monday, barring a last-minute stay, after a federal appeals
court ruled on Sunday that the Justice Department could carry out the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/us/politics/wesley-ira-purkey-executed.html}{execution}
as planned.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/daniel-lewis-lee-execution-crime.html}{Daniel
Lewis Lee}, 47, was sentenced to death decades ago for his part in the
1996 murder of a family of three. Family members of Mr. Lee's victims
had sued the Justice Department, arguing that they could not safely
travel to witness the execution because of the coronavirus. A federal
judge in Indiana, where the execution will take place,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/first-federal-execution-delay.html}{suspended
the plan} late Friday, but the decision on Sunday by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit put it back on track.

The family plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, which would have to act
before 4 p.m. Monday to stop the execution.

The Trump administration announced in July 2019 its campaign to bring
back the federal death penalty from what had been a de facto moratorium.
But legal challenges to the federal government's proposed execution
protocol delayed the procedures. Less than a month ago, the Justice
Department renewed that push,
\href{https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/executions-scheduled-four-federal-inmates-convicted-murdering-children}{scheduling
four executions this summer,} all of which were of inmates convicted of
murdering children. Three, including Mr. Lee, are scheduled to die this
week.

Several family members of Mr. Lee's victims --- including those who had
filed the lawsuit --- have
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/arkansas-federal-death-penalty.html}{called
for the Justice Department to commute his sentence} to life in prison.
But in the lawsuit filed last week, they argued that their pre-existing
conditions, including congestive heart failure and asthma, made
traveling hundreds of miles to attend the execution especially risky.

Not anticipating the court's decision, two family members of the victims
missed scheduled flights from Washington State on Sunday morning, when
the stay was still in effect, said the family's lawyer, Baker Kurrus. He
said it was too difficult for Earlene Branch Peterson, 81, whose
daughter and granddaughter were killed by Mr. Lee, to drive hundreds of
miles to the execution from her home in Arkansas.

``It's very distressing to think that the U.S. government put its full
power behind the idea that they need to hurry up and kill Danny Lee even
though there hasn't been an execution in 17 years --- even though that
rendered the rights of my clients illusory,'' Mr. Kurrus said. ``They're
stomping on the rights of victims of crimes.''

Diane S. Sykes, the appeals court's chief judge, wrote in a ruling for
the appeals panel that the family did not have a protected right to bear
witness to Mr. Lee's execution but rather only permitted to attend.

The decision reversed the temporary injunction, issued on Friday by
Chief Judge Jane E. Magnus-Stinson of the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Indiana, an Obama appointee. The Seventh
Circuit is among the most conservative appeals courts in the country,
with only two Democratic presidential appointees among its 14 judges.
President Trump has already appointed four judges to its bench.

As the coronavirus spread, the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute,
Ind., suspended all visits to the prison, even as the four men on death
row learned that their executions had again been scheduled. After the
Bureau of Prisons reopened visitation for their legal counsel last
month, lawyers for the men worried that visiting their clients could
expose them and their loved ones to the coronavirus.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/politics/federal-executions-pandemic.html}{The
lawyers argued} that the pandemic prevented them from adequately
defending their clients during a critical time in their cases.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

``There's a resurgence in the pandemic,'' said Ruth Friedman, Mr. Lee's
lawyer and the director of the Federal Capital Habeas Project. She added
that the Justice Department ``said they owe it to the victims, but I
guess they don't owe it to the victims'' to ensure their health.

According to the Bureau of Prisons, participants in Mr. Lee's execution
will be required to wear masks and have their temperatures checked.

Spiritual advisers for the two other federal inmates scheduled to be
executed this week have filed complaints similar to those by Mrs.
Peterson and her family, arguing that pre-existing conditions put them
at risk of contracting the virus if they attend. Their lawsuit is
pending.

According to a recent filing in the lawsuit, a Bureau of Prisons
official at the Terre Haute penitentiary tested positive for the
coronavirus last week after attending a meeting to plan for the
executions and protests that might occur outside the facility. He also
tended to an issue at the Special Confinement Unit, which houses the
federal death row inmates. The bureau is in the process of contact
tracing, the filing said, but the staff member did not come into contact
with anyone who will conduct the executions or plan victim witness
transportation and logistics.

The bureau did not respond to a request for comment Sunday.
