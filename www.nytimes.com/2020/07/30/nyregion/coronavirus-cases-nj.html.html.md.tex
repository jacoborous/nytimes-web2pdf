``The numbers are setting off alarms,'' Gov. Philip Murphy said.

Coronavirus cases in New Jersey, which just a week ago had plunged to
their lowest levels since the pandemic began, are rising again, fueled
in part by outbreaks among young adults along the Jersey Shore.

As of Thursday, New Jersey had recorded an average of 434 cases per day
over the last week, an increase of 35 percent from the average two weeks
earlier, according to a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-jersey-coronavirus-cases.html}{database}
maintained by The New York Times. On Friday, there were 699 new
coronavirus cases, Gov. Philip D. Murphy said.

``The numbers are setting off alarms,'' Mr. Murphy said, adding, ``We
are standing in a very dangerous place.''

The increase has worried elected leaders and public health officials who
say that young people who are enjoying summer parties are not taking
enough precautions.

A party that dozens of Long Beach Island lifeguards attended has been
linked to 35 cases of the virus, according to the state's health
commissioner. A house party in Middletown, N.J., has been blamed for 65
new cases; 52 of the people infected were between the ages of 15 and 19,
Mr. Murphy said. And a graduation party in Westfield, N.J., farther
north, resulted in 17 cases.

``We are not past this,'' the governor warned. ``Everyone who walks
around refusing to wear a mask, or who hosts an indoor house party or
who overstuffs a boat is directly contributing to these increases. This
has to stop.''

The head of the State Police has said the parties may be linked to the
continued shutdown of indoor bars and restaurant dining, spawning what
he called an ``underground situation.''

In perhaps the most glaring example of this apparent thirst for
summertime revelry, a party at an Airbnb rental in Jackson, N.J., about
65 miles south of Manhattan, drew more than 700 people on Sunday night,
leading the police to issue tickets to the three organizers. More than
100 cars were parked outside, and it took the police more than five
hours to clear the scene. On Friday, Airbnb announced it was removing 35
listings across New Jersey as part of an effort to crack down on illicit
house parties.

Just a week ago, New Jersey recorded its
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-jersey-coronavirus-cases.html}{lowest
seven-day average} of new daily coronavirus cases --- 224 --- since the
numbers peaked in the state in early April.

The milestone came even as the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/nyregion/jersey-shore-reopen-coronavirus.html}{Jersey
Shore beaches} were in full swing,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/nyregion/atlantic-city-casinos-reopening-coronavirus.html}{Atlantic
City's casinos} were open and towns across the state were walling off
streets to create lively outdoor-dining bazaars.

Aides to Mr. Murphy touted the achievement on
\href{https://twitter.com/GunaRockYa/status/1286285839744618496}{Twitter,}
noting that New Jersey was the only state in the nation to have achieved
a
\href{https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/07/only-one-state-in-the-us-has-seen-covid-19-cases-drop-for-two-weeks-running.html}{two-week
decline} in new cases of the virus.

On Thursday, it was New York's turn to crow. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said
that New York had reached new lows in the number of people hospitalized
with Covid-19 or on ventilators. The rate of positive test results was
1.09 percent in New York --- half of New Jersey's 2.15 percent positive
rate on Friday.

Mr. Cuomo said he had no plan to bar residents of New Jersey from coming
to New York.

``I don't know how you could quarantine New Jersey,'' Mr. Cuomo said.
``They don't fly into New York. You'd have to blockade roads, and we're
not talking about blockading.''

Officials with Mr. Murphy's office noted on Thursday that despite the
uptick, New Jersey continues to be among the six states with the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html\#states}{fewest
new daily infections} per 100,000 residents. Some of the increase in the
last week also can be linked to a lag in testing results, which they
said are sometimes delivered in large bulk batches, skewing the daily
case counts.

On Wednesday, for example, the state reported 489 new cases of the
virus; on Thursday, there were 261. On Friday --- the first day since
March 10 without a single Covid-19 death in New Jersey --- the number
spiked again to 699 cases.

The governor has not minced words about the worrisome trend, or its
potential to undermine months of conscientious efforts to reduce the
spread of the virus that has been linked to
\href{https://covid19.nj.gov/}{15,819 deaths} in the state.

``Over the past four months, we have crushed the curve,'' he warned on
Wednesday. ``But folks, this is sobering.''

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

He added: ``We can't go backward. We can't afford to go backward.''

Perry N. Halkitis, an epidemiologist and dean of the Rutgers School of
Public Health, agreed the delay in testing results muddies the daily
data report.

But he said the seven-day trend is alarming.

``It's time for us to say, `Indicators are bad,''' Dr. Halkitis said.
``People are just gathering with no thought in mind.''

He added, ``It's almost like we have to re-pause, right now, before it
gets too late.''

The risk of the virus has hit close to his home turf: The number of
Rutgers University football players infected with the virus grew to 15
on Wednesday, the health commissioner, Judith M. Persichilli, said. The
college announced on Saturday that it had suspended in-person team
activities and placed all the players under quarantine.

Dr. Halkitis said he was concerned about schools reopening in just over
a month for in-person instruction.

``The thing that keeps me up at night is the schools,'' he said. ``It's
absolutely an `uh-oh' moment.''

George Helmy, the governor's chief of staff, said they take every
increase in virus cases seriously, and will continue to monitor any
changes in the spread of the virus.

Mr. Murphy has said his goal is to try to open all schools for at least
some in-person learning, though the final decisions are being made by
individual districts.

``New Jersey has the best public education system in the nation and the
governor believes that in-person learning for our children is essential
for their academic advancement, social and mental well-being and
development,'' Mr. Helmy said on Thursday.

``Public health informs all of our decisions and we continue to assess
and reassess our data as we get closer to the first day of school.''
