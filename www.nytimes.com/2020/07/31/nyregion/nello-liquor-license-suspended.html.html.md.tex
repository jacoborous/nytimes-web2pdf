The Upper East Side restaurant was accused of serving eight people
inside, violating New York's orders.

Nello, an Italian restaurant and celebrity hot spot on the Upper East
Side of Manhattan, has long been a showroom for wealthy New Yorkers
undeterred by its lofty prices.

When the coronavirus pandemic forced the venue to shut its dining room,
its flamboyant spirit was on full display.

To promote public health, the restaurant placed large, ruby-hued
\href{https://www.instagram.com/p/CAWO_ptHZkY/?igshid=1hs6i7mj6zg5i}{teddy
bears wearing face masks} at its sidewalk tables. When outdoor dining
resumed, the plush animals remained, huddled around a bottle of hand
sanitizer and signs encouraging patrons to stay six feet apart.

But this week, state officials said that Nello violated the same state
guidance it had urged customers to follow, when it served at least eight
people indoors despite a citywide ban on doing so.

As a result, the \href{https://sla.ny.gov/}{State Liquor Authority}
suspended Nello's liquor license, adding the high-profile restaurant to
a list of dozens of establishments that have been penalized as the state
agency mounts a crackdown on social-distancing violations.

Nello's management did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

For weeks, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has denounced crowds gathering outside
New York City restaurants and bars, in what he has deemed flagrant
violations of the state's social-distancing guidelines.

``What they're doing is stupid and reckless for themselves and for other
people,'' Mr. Cuomo said last week. ``And it has to stop.''

In June, as warmer weather brought more New Yorkers outdoors, Mr. Cuomo
shifted the burden on bar and restaurant owners to control the crowds
outside their buildings.

He also gave the State Liquor Authority the power to suspend the liquor
licenses of businesses that were not doing enough to comply with rules.

As cases of the virus began surging in the rest of the country, Mr.
Cuomo sounded the alarm more frequently. Two weeks ago, the state told
bars and restaurants that they
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/nyregion/ny-bars-open-cuomo.html?module=inline}{could
not serve alcohol to people who did not buy food}.

Last week, the state created a task force, led by the liquor authority
and the State Police, that promised to send investigators to respond to
reports of social-distancing violations.

Mr. Cuomo has cast the crackdown as an effort to reduce outdoor crowds
and prevent a potential second spike in cases. But
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/nyregion/nyc-phase-4-reopening-bars.html?module=inline}{bar
and restaurant owners have said} the mounting regulations are confusing
and unnecessarily burdensome.

Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the New York City Hospitality
Alliance, an industry group, said businesses that were already suffering
because of the pandemic had been struggling to adapt to shifting
guidelines.

``They're losing their livelihoods, they've laid off employees and
they're trying to survive,'' Mr. Rigie said. ``And now they're trying to
operate in an extremely difficult situation where the guidance continues
to change.''

Even so, most of the city's restaurants and bars are complying with the
guidance, Mr. Rigie said. He called those violating the rules ``a few
bad operators.''

Since the state's shutdown and social-distancing orders went into effect
in March, 64 businesses have had their liquor licenses suspended for
violations, officials said. The vast majority of those suspensions ---
41 --- have come in the last two weeks.

The crackdown has overwhelmingly targeted establishments in New York
City. Of the 41 businesses, all but three are in the city's five
boroughs, and 27 of them --- about two-thirds --- are in Queens.

Across the state, 549 businesses have been charged with violating the
state orders since March, and 408 of them are in New York City.

The majority of the businesses that have been penalized have been
accused by the liquor authority of violations related to outdoor dining
and drinking.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

Mr. Rigie said that restaurant and bar owners felt particularly
frustrated by the state guidance making them responsible for controlling
the spaces outside their premises.

``When you see police having trouble dispersing large crowds of people,
how do we expect restaurant workers to do it?'' Mr. Rigie said. ``And
why would we expect them to be able to?''

Against a backdrop of bars and restaurants accused of improper outdoor
drinking, Nello, which was accused of serving patrons inside, would seem
to stand apart.

In the decades since the restaurant opened uptown in 1992, it has become
a favorite of boldfaced names and well-heeled New Yorkers drawn to its
elegant atmosphere.

Nello's immoderate prices ---
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/your-money/at-nello-a-case-of-restaurant-bill-shock-the-haggler.html}{specials
can cost hundreds of dollars}, and many online reviews have complained
of sticker shock --- have made it a bastion for the city's upper crust.
It has been the background of many paparazzi photos and has made
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/fashion/27nello.html}{frequent
appearances on Page Six}, The New York Post's gossip column.

Time has not softened the restaurant's appeal. Donald Trump Jr., the
president's eldest child,
\href{https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt4w89HA8Hv/?utm_source=ig_embed}{spent
Valentine's Day at Nello} last year, and the cast of ``The Real
Housewives of New York'' filmed a scene at the eatery
\href{https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/real-housewives-of-new-york-city-recap-season-12-episode-6.html}{that
was broadcast in May}.

Yet Nello's glitzy trappings and hefty price tag have not, apparently,
matched the caliber of Nello's food. In a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/dining/reviews/14rest.html}{New
York Times review of the restaurant in 2010}, Sam Sifton offered the
rather plain assessment that ``the food is not very good,'' describing
dishes as tasting like ``shirt cardboard'' and ``sliced shoe.''

Mr. Sifton gave the restaurant zero stars, but did note its clublike
atmosphere. ``The restaurant's customer base is built of the richest and
most coddled people in the city, who love it for its elegance and,
perhaps, simplicity,'' he wrote.

On Friday, Bill Crowley, a spokesman for the State Liquor Authority,
said inspectors found patrons sitting inside Nello, a violation of
regulations in place since March that forbid indoor dining.

A waiter at the restaurant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized to talk to the news media, said that
inspectors took issue with two tables set up at the edge of the
restaurant where its doors open onto the street.

The waiter, who said he was there when inspectors arrived, said Nello
had been told twice this month that the tables were consistent with
state guidelines.

Mr. Crowley disputed that account, saying that the eight customers were
clearly seated indoors.
