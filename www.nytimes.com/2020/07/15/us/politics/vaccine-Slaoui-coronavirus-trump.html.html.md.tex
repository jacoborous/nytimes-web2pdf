Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser for the Trump administration's
coronavirus vaccine program, can remain a government contractor, thus
shielding him from disclosure rules.

WASHINGTON --- The scientist leading the Trump administration's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html}{coronavirus
vaccine} program will be allowed to remain a government contractor, a
decision that permits him to avoid ethics disclosures required of
federal employees and maintain his investments in pharmaceutical
companies.

Two prominent watchdog groups as well as some Democrats in Congress had
called for the Department of Health and Human Services to require that
the scientist, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, a venture capitalist and a former
executive at the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, fall under the
same ethics rules as federal employees.

The office of the inspector general at H.H.S. responded this week that
it could not require such a shift, citing the unusual role that Dr.
Slaoui was playing in the administration amid the pandemic.

As the chief adviser for the vaccine program ---~called Operation Warp
Speed --- Dr. Slaoui is working on a contract that pays him \$1. Under
the arrangement, he is exempt from federal disclosure rules that would
require him to list his outside positions, stock holdings and other
potential conflicts of interest.

That arrangement has alarmed lawmakers, who have accused H.H.S. of
helping Dr. Slaoui, an expert in molecular biology and immunology, duck
the usual accountability required of government employees.

The groups that filed the May complaint, Public Citizen and Lower Drug
Prices Now, argued for Dr. Slaoui to be classified as a ``special
government employee,'' a tag that allows the federal government to hire
outside experts for up to 130 days. The title would make him subject to
ethics rules that also apply to regular government employees.

The \$1 contract,
\href{https://www.citizen.org/article/covid-19-vaccine-czar-moncef-slaoui-should-be-classified-as-a-special-government-employee/}{the
groups said}, appears ``designed primarily to allow Slaoui to maintain
an extensive web of conflicting financial interests without the need to
divest of, recuse from or disclose those conflicting interests'' and
``provides Slaoui with the opportunity to enrich himself, his colleagues
and his employers.''

In its reply to the groups, an official in the inspector general's
office said that Dr. Slaoui's appointment is expected to stretch beyond
200 days, well past what it said was the ``applicable statutory time
limit'' for a special government employee.

The inspector general's office ``is not in a position to determine that
the department's decision was unreasonable when it pursued options other
than an S.G.E. appointment,'' the letter, dated July 13, concluded.

In his role, Dr. Slaoui has significant influence over financial
commitments made by the government, which
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/health/novavax-coronavirus-vaccine-warp-speed.html}{has
so far provided little information} about Warp Speed's resources, which
agencies the funding is coming from or how decisions are being made.

``The basic idea that he's in a really privileged position with lots of
resources to command and that he has a personal financial stake in the
industry is really challenging,'' said Margarida Jorge, the campaign
director for Lower Drug Prices Now. **``**Everyone can appreciate that
Slaoui has expertise in the development of vaccines, but expertise and
ethics should not be mutually exclusive.''

A group of Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of
Massachusetts, separately
\href{https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020.06.15\%20Letter\%20about\%20Operation\%20Warp\%20Speed\%20conflicted\%20adviser\%20arrangement.pdf}{wrote}
last month to Alex M. Azar II, the health secretary, asking for Dr.
Slaoui to be designated a special government employee. They called Dr.
Slaoui's contract ``an attempted end-run around federal ethics rules.''

Ms. Jorge said that her organization and other watchdog groups were
planning to meet Wednesday afternoon to discuss new ways to challenge
Dr. Slaoui's status.

The Trump administration has invested nearly \$4 billion in companies
pursuing coronavirus vaccines. Last week, H.H.S. announced that the
federal government will pay Novavax, a Maryland company that has never
brought a product to market, \$1.6 billion to expedite the development
of a

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

Dr. Slaoui spent his first days on the job in May
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccine-czar.html}{trying
to disentangle} pieces of his stock portfolio and other ties to
pharmaceutical interests. Before working for the Trump administration,
he sat on the board of Moderna, a biotechnology firm pursuing a
coronavirus vaccine. He sold his shares in the company after the value
of his stock holdings soared following the release of preliminary
vaccine trial data.

The Trump administration said at the time that Dr. Slaoui would donate
the increased value to cancer research.

In
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccine-czar.html}{an
interview} in May, Dr. Slaoui said he was determined to avoid conflicts
and would re-evaluate any remaining associations if his financial
interests stood to gain more from his new post.

An H.H.S. spokeswoman reiterated on Wednesday that Dr. Slaoui resigned
from Moderna's board and divested his equity, in addition to leaving
advisory boards of companies ``with even the appearance of conflict.''

``H.H.S. ethics officers have determined Dr. Slaoui's contractor status,
divestiture and board resignations put him in compliance with our robust
department ethical standards,'' the spokeswoman said.

Soon after Dr. Slaoui was brought on to Project Warp Speed, its
leadership underwent further upheaval, in part because of his holdings,
according to senior administration officials.

Dr. Peter Marks, a renowned federal scientist who devised and initially
oversaw the Warp Speed project at the Food and Drug Administration,
stepped aside from his role as its lead vaccine specialist, in part
because of concern over what he saw as Dr. Slaoui's potential conflicts
of interest, the officials said. Dr. Marks is the director of the
F.D.A.'s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the office that
approves vaccines.
