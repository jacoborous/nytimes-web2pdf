\section{The Arc of a Coup Attempt in
Turkey}\label{the-arc-of-a-coup-attempt-in-turkey}}

A violent and chaotic insurrection began Friday night as two bridges in
Istanbul were seized by military forces. In the hours that followed,
factions fought for control of government buildings in the capital,
Ankara, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan re-emerged in Istanbul. By
the next day, hundreds were dead, and thousands of military personnel
were rounded up as the coup faltered.

Turkish soldiers blocked the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul around 9:30
p.m. on Friday. Seizing the bridges immediately set social media afire,
and rumors began swirling that either the military was maneuvering to
thwart a terrorist threat, or a hijacked jetliner was in the sky. Some,
though, mindful of Turkey's history of military interventions in
politics, almost immediately began wondering if a coup was starting.

Turkish soldiers detained people at the side of the road after shutting
down the Bosporus Bridge. After 10 p.m., the prime minister spoke on
television, saying a coup attempt was underway. Shortly after, Turkish
television channels reported that a faction of the military had issued a
statement saying it had seized control of the country to protect
democracy. Bulent Kilic/Agence France-Presse --- Getty Images

As the insurrection unfolded, President~Recep Tayyip Erdogan~was not
heard from for hours. He finally addressed the nation from an
undisclosed location, speaking on his cellphone's FaceTime app --- a
dramatic scene that seemed to suggest a man on the verge of losing
power.~ Burak Kara/Getty Images

Soldiers gathered in Taksim Square in Istanbul as people protested
against the coup attempt. It was a long night in Istanbul and Ankara,
full of intrigue and violence, as the crackle of gunfire and booms of
explosions intermixed with muezzins and the call to prayer, making
Turkey, for a night, feel like one of the war-torn cities in Iraq or
Syria. Emrah Gurel/Associated Press

People tried to stop military tanks in Ankara. The coup failed largely
because the conspirators misjudged the degree of public support for a
military intervention in politics. While the country is deeply
polarized, with about half the country in support of Mr. Erdogan and
half bitterly opposed, a rejection of a coup seemed to be one thing that
much of Turkish society could unite behind. Associated Press

Binali Yildirim called the insurrection ``a stain in the history of
democracy'' at a news conference on Saturday in Ankara, the capital. He
raised the death toll of the clashes to 265, with 1,440 people wounded,
and he said that 2,839 military personnel had been detained. Gokhan

time Mr. Erdogan landed in Istanbul in the early hours of Saturday that
those behind the coup did not have enough support within the military to
succeed. Defne Karadeniz/Getty Images

Mr. Erdogan held a news conference in Istanbul around 3:30 a.m. on
Saturday. He placed blame for the intrigue on the followers of Fethullah
Gulen, a Muslim cleric living in exile in Pennsylvania, who was the
president's ally until a bitter falling out three years ago. Mr. Gulen's
followers were known to have a strong presence in Turkey's police and
judiciary, but less so in the military. Huseyin Aldemir/Reuters

Turkish police arrested Turkish soldiers at Taksim Square on Saturday.
Officials said the main plotters were from the gendarmerie, a
military-style police force, the air force and some elements of the land
forces. Several generals and colonels were arrested --- none who are
high-level figures recognizable to the public --- and thousands of other
rank-and-file officers and soldiers were rounded up Saturday in a purge
that was likely to go on for some time. Sedat Suna/European Pressphoto

forces in Istanbul early on Saturday. A turning point in the night was
when Mr. Erdogan was able to communicate with the public, and his
supporters responded to his call to go out in the streets and protest
the coup. All night long, the loudspeakers of mosques were exhorting
citizens to rise up and oppose the coup. Gurcan Ozturk/Agence

Much of the violence overnight related to the coup attempt was in
Ankara, where different branches of the security forces fought one
another over control of government buildings, including the Parliament
building, seen here, where several explosions were reported. Adem

Thousands gathered to rally in support of Mr. Erdogan near the Turkish
Parliament building in Ankara on Saturday. By the afternoon, after a
standoff in Ankara, the government had wrested back an Army headquarters
building from coup plotters. Mr. Erdogan, who had frequently talked of
conspiracies afoot to undermine his power, was back in control,
seemingly as powerful as ever, and perhaps even more paranoid. Nicole
