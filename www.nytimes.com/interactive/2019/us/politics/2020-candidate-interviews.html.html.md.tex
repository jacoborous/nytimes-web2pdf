The New York Times reached out to 22 Democratic presidential candidates
to ask them the same set of questions on video. Twenty-one accepted the
invitation.

Most of the candidates visited the studio in our New York City office;
for a few who could not, we traveled to Iowa, Texas and Washington, D.C.
The sessions took place between the beginning of March and early June.
During the interviews, we asked candidates to answer each question
briefly --- with a simple yes or no, or another terse, direct reply ---
before explaining their views at greater length.

One candidate, Elizabeth Warren, who was the first to be interviewed,
returned for a second session after we added a number of questions to
our initial list. We did not ask John Hickenlooper when his family first
arrived in the United States because we added that question after his
interview.

In the case of one question --- regarding President Trump's legal issues
--- the candidates answered at different points during the completion of
the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/us/politics/mueller-report-russian-interference-donald-trump.html?module=inline}{investigation
by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III}, so their answers reflected
the facts available to them at the time.
