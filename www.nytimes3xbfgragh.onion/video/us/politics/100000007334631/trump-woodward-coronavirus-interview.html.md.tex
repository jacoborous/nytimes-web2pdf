  Reporter: ``Why did you lie to the American people, and why should we
  trust what you have to say now?'' ``Such a terrible question, and the
  phraseology --- I didn't lie. What I said is we have to be calm, we
  can't be panicked. Bob Woodward is somebody that I respect just from
  hearing the name for many, many years --- not knowing too much about
  his work, and not caring about his work. But I thought it would be
  interesting to talk to him for a period of calls. But certainly if he
  thought that was a bad statement, he would have reported it because he
  thinks that, you know, you don't want to have anybody that is going to
  suffer medically because of some fact, and he didn't report it because
  he didn't think it was bad. Nobody thought it was --- wait a minute,
  wait a minute --- and your question, the way you phrased that, is such
  a disgrace. It's a disgrace to ABC television network. It's a disgrace
  to your employer. What I went out and said was very simple. Listen,
  what I want out and said was very simple. I want to show a level of
  confidence, and I want to show strength as a leader. And I want to
  show that our country is going to be fine one way or the other.''
