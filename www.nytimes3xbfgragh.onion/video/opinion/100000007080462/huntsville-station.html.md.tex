  Ya'll cash those checks, get your bus ticket over here. Y'all listen
  up real quick for me, please. The time schedule of your bus ticket
  leaving here is wrong. If you go by that 2:30 and 1:30, you might be
  the only one sitting here if the bus pulls up. So it'd be best don't
  go nowhere. If y`all need to call home, I got multiple cellphones you
  can use to call your family. We're waiting on Houston bus, Dallas bus.
  Once it pulls up, a parole officer will say, ``Dallas load up, Houston
  load up.'' That's when y'all load up and leave. You need to call home?
  Just cashing it, sir? 50, 70, 90, 100. McCallan 2:40 in the morning.
  Dallas is 4:00, 4:30. Next. El Paso 5:50 in the morning. Still gotta
  wait like two, three more hours. I can't believe he gave me my old ID.
  Had to have been about 33, 32, something like that. I was young back
  then. Yes, ma'am, I'm trying to get ahold of property. I had some
  cards, credit cards, and it wasn't sent down here to Huntsville. I
  need that money that's on them cards. Anybody want a fan? That riot I
  was in over there, they stabbed me. Got hit, but... How many times?
  Three. Right in the same spot. They almost hit my main vein right
  there but again, it all comes with the territory. You gotta do what
  you gotta do to survive in there. I know one thing. This is really
  overwhelming for me. It's too much. I'm ready to lay down and close my
  eyes. I ain't been to sleep all night. I ain't slept since yesterday.
  Answer the phone. Who else need to call home? Like I tell everybody,
  it's just a donation to call home, whatever it's worth to you. There
  you go, sir. Thank you. God bless you, bro. God bless you too, man.
  Well, how in the heck do you work this thing? I'm sorry. What's the
  number? Where that guy at trying to get that touch-screen Galaxy
  phone? Who else needs to call home? J, Y... It might be my lucky day.
  Hey, man. I got - I got some very important shit I need to talk to you
  about, man. Hey, I'm blown away right now too, bro. Hey, man it's just
  a trip just being out, man. You know what I'm saying? Hey, man, I know
  I sent you that letter, man. But just disregard that, man. Because I
  know you take care of stuff, man. You know what I'm saying? All right,
  bro. I love you, man. All right, bye-bye. Hey, who here trying to
  smell good? I got some Curve! Anybody trying to get a squirt? Let me
  get some of it. 50 cents for two squirts, four for \$1. For real?
  Yeah. Appreciate you. Thank you. Who else trying to smell good? Fifty
  cents for two squirts, four for \$1. Just blessed to be free again. I
  need to be fishing, man. Man, I need to be fishing. Big-mouth bass,
  big old white perches. I love it. 30 years. It's 30 years. (SOBBING)
  My whole life, man. You know what I'm saying? It's 30 years, man. You
  know you never think it's gonna come. And you know ... I can't say I
  don't believe it, you know, because I do. But ... It's real, but it
  ain't. It's more surreal, you know? Dallas! Dallas, let's go! What's
  up, man? It's your big brother, man. Man, that's how you know I'm
  free. Man, I'm outside in this free world, man. I'm fixing to get read
  y... Hey! Hey I'm ... listen, I'm fixing to get ready to get on this
  Greyhound bus right now. I'll be in Dallas probably about anywhere ---
  I'll be in Dallas in about three and a half hours. Well, I got this
  GPS thing on me, so I really ain't going to be able to make too many
  moves. Say man, I love y'all and I miss y'all. I'm on my way to the
  house. {[}TRAIN HORN{]} {[}BIRDS CHIRPING{]} {[}CLANKING SOUND{]}
