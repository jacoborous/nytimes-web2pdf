  {[}MUSIC PLAYING{]} I am a person who walks looking down, because you
  can find lots of great things on the ground. I'm basically a recycler.
  You know, I find other people's stuff and junk and recycle it into my
  stuff and junk. I can't pass a yard sale. Action. Is that the word?
  Yeah, action. I come from a household where my mother was very
  artistic. In her era, women made quilts. They crocheted. They did
  things with their hands. Women were not particularly encouraged to be
  artists, especially women of color, so design was my choice at school.
  Through the years, I shifted into other kinds of art. My favorite
  probably is collage and assemblage, where I mix up materials, objects,
  ideas. Sometimes they tell a story, and sometimes they don't. I prefer
  it when they don't tell a story, so the viewer can invent their own
  story. I rarely look for a specific thing. I just kind of spot. I kind
  of go by my intuition. I can tell when a fan has something for me that
  I might use. At that time, there were very few black artists in Los
  Angeles. There was a larger community, a national community. They were
  having a conference in Chicago. So David Hammons and I decided that we
  wanted to go. During our spare time we went to the Field Museum.
  African art, oceanic art, primitive art, and folk art were not really
  considered art, so they were down in the basement. And it was weird
  down there, because it was all this energy from these tribal kinds of
  materials. When we came back to California, that was when I started
  doing the ancestral cast pieces, working with objects from Africa and
  organic things. When you know Betye and you start to really look into
  her work, you'd think that she escaped from one of the pyramids or
  something, you know what I mean? She's just into a strong mystical
  quality. I was always interested in alternative beliefs, palmistry and
  phonology, astrology, and so forth. In the '60s, I became more
  interested in what was happening about feminism and racism. Dr. Martin
  Luther King Jr., his murder was something that was really horrific for
  me and shocking. I remember how I felt physically, just really angry
  and upset. But I was a mother with young children. I couldn't walk in
  protest. But I did have a weapon. And that was art. That was when I
  started using black derogatory images. I did this piece called `The
  Liberation of Aunt Jemima,' because it went back to how black people
  were thought of as comical, or caricatures, or animals. And I wanted
  to do something to show my protest for that, so I made Aunt Jemima as
  a warrior, as a fighter. She has a rifle and a hand grenade. She's
  taking care of business. I was really hesitant about putting that
  figure up there. Some people thought it was humorous. But it did
  something that I didn't know it would do. It made people think. It's
  been forever. Racism hasn't gone away. Has sexism gone away? No. So
  you still have to keep repeating things. My daughter found this scale
  for me --- the weight of racism or so forth. I will probably paint the
  outside of it green and the inside red, so it looks like they're in a
  watermelon. That's my sense of humor. This sounds really gross. I
  applied for a National Endowment. And I received --- I don't know how
  many thousand. But when I got that check, I looked in the mirror, and
  I said, ``Oh, Betye Saar. You're really an artist.'' Before I was just
  making stuff. I've been used to being a long admirer of hers for a
  long time. And suddenly, everywhere I go, people talk about her work.
  We're in a culture that likes objects. You're attracted maybe to
  beauty, or to usefulness. Or there's other objects that you look and
  you're disgusted with them. Everything has a past, so I feel that that
  energy is somehow enclosed with the object. What do I have now that's
  new? Antlers. That's my latest thing. Antlers. It's always a
  puzzlement when I start collecting things. Like, ``What can I do with
  this? I mean, what's the point of that?'' And then I'll find another
  component and it says, ``Oh, yeah. I can use it here.'' It's a very
  selfish reason that I make art. Because I like doing it. I'm in my 90s
  now. And all these pieces are sitting around waiting for me to put
  them together. And time is the biggest challenge. To find time to do
  it. I do have a birthday coming up. I'm a Leo. It means that I am like
  the lion. It's best you not hear me roar. And that's a wrap.
