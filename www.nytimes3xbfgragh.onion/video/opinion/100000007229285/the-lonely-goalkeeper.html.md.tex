  {[}MUSIC PLAYING{]} {[}APPLAUSE{]} Hello, chaps. My name's Bob Wilson.
  Arsenal goalkeeper, Arsenal legend, if you like. ``Wilson leading off
  Liverpool once again. Bob Wilson Cup. Rock solid once again.''
  {[}CROWD CHEERING{]} ``Oh! And a great save by Wilson.'' I was a
  nervous goalie. And that was the buildup. The day before I started to
  get worked up about it. And I went off into this unknown world. By the
  time the bell went in the dressing room to go out, I was a bag of
  nerves. My stomach was churning. I'd been to the loo four times. And
  then I'd go down the tunnel, and I hit daylight --- {[}CROWD
  CHEERING{]} --- and the 40 ... 50 ... 80,000 and went, yep, this is
  what you've chosen, boy. This is great. Football is a team game. It's
  11 players gelling together, understanding each other. The whole
  purpose of a game of football is to score goals. And the one villain
  in the piece is the bloke between the sticks, the goalie. They're the
  only individual in what is a team game. There is an incredible
  loneliness about it. The other 10 guys can make numerous mistakes in a
  game. Even the star striker, he can miss five, six, eight chances in a
  game and score a winning goal in the 89th minute of a match, and he
  goes home the hero. ``Oh, that was beautiful!'' On the reverse
  situation, you are putting yourself in this position where for 89
  minutes you play brilliantly. And in the 90th minute, you make a
  positional error, or the ball moves, swerves and dips. And it looks as
  if it's your fault because it just makes you look a fool, an absolute
  total fool. And everybody behind the goal goes home casting
  dispersions about your parentage. You know you think about it, this
  thin tightrope that a goalie walks. You're underneath your crossbar in
  between your posts, which is a massive area anyway. People don't
  realize it's eight yards wide, and it's eight foot high. And it's a
  chasm! It's not just a big area. It's a chasm! And you are very
  capable of falling off at any opportunity. I think you have got to be
  different. All great goalies need a desperate sort of courage within
  their makeup. When all is lost, when their defensive barriers and
  their structures and playing 4-4-2 or catenaccios, like the Italians
  do. When all else fails, those guys in front of you, those 10 guys,
  need to look `round and say, ``The goalie will save us. The big man
  will save us.'' That's when you're tested. And that's why I went head
  first, hand first, for the sake of winning a game of football. It's
  suddenly that belief in yourself. I belong. That is the ultimate. You
  have the respect of all of your team. And that was my greatest reward,
  and it's the greatest reward any footballer can ever get. {[}MUSIC
