The Taliban have a significant footprint in Afghanistan, according to
Bill Roggio, the editor of The
\href{http://www.longwarjournal.org/}{Long War Journal}, an online
publication that is tracking Taliban control. Mr. Roggio has been able
to confirm that about one-fifth of the country is controlled or
contested by the Taliban, but he emphasized that this was a conservative
estimate. ``They probably either control or heavily influence about a
half of the country,'' he said.

According to Mr. Roggio, ``contested'' districts are those where the
Afghan government controls the district center but the Taliban control
large areas outside of the district center. ``Control'' means the
Taliban are openly administering a district. Taliban control has
fluctuated over the past 14 years. The Taliban government collapsed
after the American invasion, but the group regained control of multiple
districts between 2005 and 2009, Mr. Roggio said. They withdrew from
these areas after the temporary surge of American troops at the
beginning of President Obama's administration, but they have been
reclaiming territory since 2013.

Taliban fighters have been attacking areas of Kunduz Province since
August of last year. Within hours of their advance on Monday, they took
control of Kunduz city, the provincial capital. A counterattack began on
Tuesday, but Afghan forces failed to retake the city as the Taliban
ended the day with another aggressive advance.
