With an anti-establishment style that has changed little over five
decades, Mr. Sanders has attracted a loyal cadre of fans. He often
boasts, correctly, that some of his agenda items once considered radical
---
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/27/us/politics/bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all.html}{Medicare
for all},'' a \$15 minimum wage, tuition-free public college --- have
now been embraced by many Democrats.

Running for president a second time, he is one of the most-well known
candidates in the race. But he remains something of an outsider: A
self-described democratic socialist, he has never joined the party he
hopes to lead.

Democratic socialism
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/12/us/politics/democratic-socialism-facts-history.html}{has
become a powerful force in American political life}, but its definition
is up for debate. Generally, it falls somewhere between communism and
social democracy, which is common in Europe.

Strictly speaking, democratic socialists do not support capitalism,
meaning they want workers to control the means of production. Unlike
communists, democratic socialists also believe that socialism should be
achieved democratically.

Mr. Sanders has long called for eliminating tuition at public colleges
and universities. And in June, two months after one of his rivals,
Senator Elizabeth Warren, proposed canceling
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/22/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-student-debt.html}{most
student loan debt}, Mr. Sanders went even further,
helping\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-student-debt.html}{to}\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-student-debt.html}{introduce
legislation} to eliminate \emph{all} of the country's student debt.

Mr. Sanders earned plaudits for his plan from his supporters, as well as
from some in the education field. But other analysts were skeptical
about its feasibility.

According to 10 years of tax returns that

in April}, Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane O'Meara Sanders, reported
income that topped \$1 million in 2016 and 2017, in part from proceeds
from his books.

His income puts him within the top 1 percent of taxpayers, creating some
political awkwardness for the senator, who often speaks against
``millionaires and billionaires.''
