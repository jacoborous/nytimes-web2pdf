A full day with the city's lovers and their endless expressions of
romance, from hand holding to getting married, shopping at Ikea to
attending sex parties.

delivered to your inbox every week.} JUNE 7, 2018

This special issue of The New York Times Magazine is dedicated entirely
to love in New York City over the course of a single day: Saturday, May
19, 2018. All the photography was shot on that date between 12 a.m. and
11:59 p.m. By choosing this theme and so tightly limiting the time
frame, we hoped to convey the city's magical density of intimacies, the
way it juxtaposes (especially as the weather begins to warm) the private
communion of one pair of lovers with the rollicking public energy of the
bustling crowd --- itself composed of numberless lovers communing
privately amid the noise, all the center of their own universe.
