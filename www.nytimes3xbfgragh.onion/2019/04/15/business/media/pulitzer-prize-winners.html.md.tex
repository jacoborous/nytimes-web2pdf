The Sun Sentinel's sweeping coverage of the causes and consequences of
the deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in
Parkland, Fla., shaped the national gun safety debate and prompted
changes in local policies. The paper addressed a

investigation} of President Trump's finances debunked his claims of
self-made wealth and revealed a business empire "riddled with tax
dodges," the Pulitzer committee said. The series led city and state
officials in New York to open investigations into whether Mr. Trump and
his family had underpaid taxes on his father's real estate empire and
participated in fraudulent tax schemes. This is the fourth Pulitzer for
Mr. Barstow; Ms. Craig, 51, and Mr. Buettner, 57, have been finalists.

Constitution noted explicitly that the law would perpetuate ``the
supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon race in Louisiana." After the series
appeared, Louisiana voters amended their Constitution to require
unanimous verdicts. "It seemed to help turn the tide," said Gordon

The Reuters staff and two reporters specifically were honored for
``\href{https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/myanmar-rohingya/}{expertly
exposing} the military units and Buddhist villagers responsible for the
systematic expulsion and murder of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar.'' The
reporters, Wa Lone, 33, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 29, were arrested in December
2017 and later sentenced to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/03/world/asia/myanmar-reuters-journalists-sentenced-trial.html}{seven
years in prison} for reporting on the atrocities. Stephen J. Adler,
Reuters' top editor, said he was ``thrilled'' for the recognition, but
``deeply distressed'' that they reporters were still imprisoned.

Ms. Michael, Mr. al-Zikry and Ms. El-Mofty won for
\href{https://apnews.com/YemenDirtyWar}{their series} ``detailing the
atrocities of the war in Yemen, including theft of food aid, deployment
of child soldiers and torture of prisoners.'' The journalists
documented, in text, video and photography, the civilian deaths caused
by United States drones and interviewed torture victims in Yemen's civil
war. Ms. Michael
\href{https://apnews.com/44f2f36b0c7b46b19b2fa32e6904b06c}{told} The

Ms. Dreier's detailed portraits of
\href{https://www.propublica.org/series/ms-13-on-long-island}{Salvadoran
immigrants} were cited for exposing how their lives had been destroyed
``by a botched federal crackdown on the international criminal gang
MS-13.'' After Ms. Dreier, 32, heard President Trump tie immigration to
gang violence, her reporting revealed that immigrants were often victims
of the crime groups. ``What was so cruel was that this population was
being preyed upon,'' she said. The series was published jointly with The
New York Times Magazine, Newsday and New York magazine.

were charged fees for their time in jail, sometimes leading to years of
debt and further imprisonment. The columns resulted in a ruling by the
Missouri Supreme Court that the practice was illegal, although Mr.
Messenger, 52, said it persists. In an interview, he called it ``a story
of human tragedy.''

book critic}, won for reviews and essays on politics, truth, immigration
and American identity in the Trump era. In an interview, he called it
``an irony of the time'' that a president with seemingly few literary
interests had fueled such a publishing explosion of topical work. ``It's
a really rich time to dig in to books as means to understand what is
going on right now,'' he said.

political turmoil surrounding the Trump administration. He was cited for
``calling out lies, hypocrisy and fraud.'' He is the first

had to stay at the office to cover something that just happened were not

equal measure, conveyed the violent conditions that Central American
migrants were leaving behind in their homelands, and the harsh response
they received from the authorities when they got to the United States.

measured, veiled women in a classroom. That these images alternate with
photos of starving infants and armed men in camouflage only heightens
their impact. In an interview, Mr. Tugnoli said he had tried to balance
depictions of the extent and immediacy of the tragedy with pictures that
displayed deep respect for their subjects' everyday lives.

Mr. Powers, 61, is known as a brainy novelist, but
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/09/books/review/overstory-richard-powers.html}{The
Overstory}'' tested even his intellectual capacity: Its central
characters are trees. The environmental plot involves humans, but also
communication occurring in nature. Mr. Powers called the Pulitzer Prize
``an astonishing recognition,'' and he said the reception to the novel
proved to him that readers were ``hungry for a story that takes the
nonhuman seriously, and tries to reconnect the human to a world we're so
alienated from.''

Ms. Drury's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/17/theater/review-theater-as-sabotage-in-the-dazzling-fairview.html}{dazzling
play} appears at first to be a family comedy, but subverts expectations
with a head-spinning shift in content and form that forces theatergoers
to think in new ways about race and the white gaze. Ms. Drury, 37, said
she was trying ``to communicate to white people what it's like walking
around in a body of color and having people judge you.'' The play, which
debuted last year at Soho Rep, will return in June

Mr. Blight, a professor at Yale University, was cited for ``a
breathtaking history'' that traced Douglass's transformation from
runaway slave to one of the most profound thinkers on race, equality and
American identity. \href{http://www.davidwblight.com/}{Mr. Blight}, 70,
began the book 12 years ago after encountering a private collection of

Mr. Stewart, a professor of black studies at the University of
California, Santa Barbara, was honored for offering ``a panoramic view
of the personal trials and artistic triumphs of the father of the Harlem
Renaissance and the movement he inspired.'' Locke, whose protégés
included Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, believed artistic
expression was crucial to racial progress. ``We don't often celebrate
people who create room and space for others,'' Mr. Stewart, 69, said.
``That's one thing I really love about Locke.''

poet C. D. Wright, died suddenly in 2016 at 67. ``I didn't write for
almost two years,'' Gander, 63, said of the period after her death. ``We
were always great readers of each other's work.'' When he started
writing again, the poems ``just came out,'' requiring less revising than
usual. He was glad readers felt, as he did, that ``writing about the
darkness might be transformative.''
