\emph{Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national
politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host.}

\emph{Before we get to today's newsletter, we wanted to let you know
about some big news that's developing this evening.}

\emph{Today, the Senate}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/14/us/politics/congress-trump-border-deal-wall.html}{\emph{voted
to approve a compromise on the border}} \emph{that includes funding for
some security measures, but not for President Trump's wall. The bill
would prevent another government shutdown, and the president was
expected to sign it.}

\emph{Just minutes before the vote, though, the White House announced
that Mr. Trump plans to declare a national emergency to build the wall.}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/14/us/politics/trump-national-emergency-border.html}{\emph{The
story is still developing; you can read the latest here}}\emph{.}

\emph{(And for those of you wondering,}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/07/us/politics/trump-national-emergency.html}{\emph{here's
an explanation of the president's emergency powers, and what exactly
they allow him to do.}}\emph{)}

\emph{\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_}

While we wait for the dust to settle from this latest fight between
President Trump and Congress, we wanted to tell you about an
under-the-radar change the Democrats are making in how they handle voter
data --- and why it could make a big difference in the 2020 presidential
race.

Political campaigns collect all kinds of information. Your address, of
course, but also things like your age, your interests, if you have kids,
your donation records. The more they know, they better they can target
ads --- so, say, a retired veteran in Oshkosh, Wis., doesn't get the
same message as a vegan freshman at New York University.

For years, Republicans had an edge in gathering this kind of
information. They had developed a platform that allowed them to share
data among state parties, the national party, campaigns and outside
groups like PACs. When Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee, the
G.O.P. exchange was there to make up for his lack of political
organization.

Now, the Democrats are taking concrete steps toward establishing their
own, similar organization. While the Democratic Data Exchange isn't as
headline-grabbing as the president declaring a national emergency, it
might just be one of the most significant steps Democrats can take in
their efforts to win in 2020.

``What we are announcing today is something that should have been in
place years ago,'' said Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, who negotiated the deal. ``In 2016, it appeared all too
frequently that Republicans knew more about voters than we did.''

The exchange will be an independent, for-profit enterprise that will
allow the national party, state parties and some independent groups,
like Planned Parenthood or labor unions, to share data. Organizations
won't know which groups contributed which information, keeping the
system from running afoul of Federal Election Commission rules.

Democrats have tried to set up such a system twice in the past and
failed. Friend of the newsletter Julie Bykowicz
\href{https://www.wsj.com/articles/fight-over-voter-data-roils-democrats-ahead-of-election-11544899956}{broke
the news in December} that the D.N.C. and state parties were locked in a
deep internal battle over who would control the data. Essentially, state
parties didn't want to get shut out of controlling their own voter files
--- a step they believed would put them on a slippery slope toward
irrelevance.

It's a fear rooted in recent history: Advisers to Barack Obama scoffed
at the Democratic establishment, believing that running against the
state parties would help cast him as the outsider against Hillary
Clinton in 2008. After Mr. Obama won the election, his team established
its own organization, Organizing for America, and let the Democratic
National Committee languish.

But Mrs. Clinton's loss in 2016 helped Democrats realize they could not
depend on a presidential nominee to reach voters. They have appointed
Howard Dean, the former D.N.C. chairman who still has a strong following
among state party leaders, as head of the new exchange, helping to
reassure local parties.

``People have spent years and millions of dollars collecting that
information and ultimately no one wants to give it away,'' said Ken
Martin, president of the Democrats' organization of state party leaders.
``But what good is data if it just sits in your file?''

\emph{It has been a year since a gunman walked into a high school in
Parkland, Fla., and killed 17 people. We were curious what, if anything,
has changed politically since then. So we asked} \emph{\textbf{Margaret
Kramer}} \emph{and} \emph{\textbf{Jennifer Harlan}}*, who*
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/13/us/parkland-shooting.html}{\emph{wrote
about the post-Parkland landscape for The Times}}\emph{. Here's what
they told us:}

From
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/14/us/school-walkout.html}{walkouts}
and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/21/us/politics/trump-guns-school-shooting.html}{calls
to action} to a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/15/us/politics/parkland-students-voting.html}{national
bus tour}, the movement led by the students from Marjory Stoneman
Douglas High School in Parkland has had a clear message: Gun control is
imperative, and young people's votes are critical to making it happen.

Their message seems to have resonated at the state level. Over the last
year, states have passed 76
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/12/14/us/politics/gun-control-laws.html}{gun-control
laws}. Here are three big ones:

\textbf{• The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act in
Florida.} The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/07/us/florida-shooting-gunman-indicted.html}{bill}
expanded mental health services, raised the minimum age for all gun
purchases to 21, established a waiting period for background checks and
allowed superintendents and sheriffs to arm school personnel. It also
banned
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/10/04/us/bump-stock-las-vegas-gun.html}{bump
stocks}, but not
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/08/us/florida-gun-bill.html}{the
AR-15}, the gun used in the Parkland shooting.

\textbf{• Ban on the sale of semiautomatic assault rifles to people
under 21 in Washington State.}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/02/us/washington-state-new-gun-law.html}{I-1639}
raised the age of assault rifle purchases to 21, mandated enhanced
background checks and added a required firearm safety course for buyers.
But sheriffs are reportedly
\href{https://www.krem.com/article/news/politics/grant-county-sheriff-joins-others-who-say-they-wont-enforce-i-1639/293-beb89b25-cce3-4150-821e-2e6a6c1b7c2b}{not
enforcing the initiative}, and the N.R.A. has filed a lawsuit to have it
overturned.

\textbf{• The Safe Act in New York.}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/29/nyregion/gun-laws-new-york.html}{The
state} banned bump stocks, extended the waiting period for buyers,
prohibited teachers from carrying guns in school and blocked individuals
who pose a threat from buying or possessing guns --- a provision known
as a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/12/14/us/politics/gun-control-laws.html}{``red
flag law.''}

But aside from a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/18/us/politics/trump-bump-stocks-ban.html}{bump
stock ban} --- spurred on by the 2017 Las Vegas massacre ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/15/us/politics/congress-inaction-guns.html}{partisan
gridlock} blocked any national changes in the last year, even as gun
deaths rose to their
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/18/us/gun-deaths.html}{highest
rates in 50 years}. Democrats, now in control of the House,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/08/us/politics/house-democrats-gun-control.html}{passed
two gun-control bills} on Wednesday, the day before the Parkland
anniversary. But Senate Republicans and President Trump will most likely
prevent the bills from ever becoming law.
