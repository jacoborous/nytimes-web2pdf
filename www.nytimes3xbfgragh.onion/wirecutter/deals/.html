If you're interested in more storage, the 256GB model is also on sale for $500, not a great deal but a solid discount.\n","offers":[{"@type":"Offer","name":"Apple iPad mini (5th generation, 64 GB)","price":"350","priceCurrency":"USD","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07PRD2NQ7?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=xm2&ascsubtag=edtestzz31582&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER","offeredBy":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Amazon"}}]}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":62,"item":{"@type":"Product","name":"Hoover Linx Cordless Stick Vacuum","url":"https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/deals/#deal-165275","image":"https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hoover-linx-cordless-stick-vacuum-cleaner-bh50010.jpg","description":"Available for $100, this is a nice drop from $120 for the Hoover Linx.

processing power, the latest-model MacBook Pro is our pick. Back down to $1600 when added to your cart, this deal is another nice drop on the more ports and more power pick from our guide to the Best MacBooks. Lighter, smaller, and more affordable than the 16-inch, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is a solid alternative to its larger sibling if you don&#x27;t mind compromising on graphics a bit. Though it&#x27;s still a pricey laptop option, recent releases from Apple usually only get marginal discounts at first. This particular version matches the specs we recommend in our guide with the quad-core Intel Core i5-1038NG7 processor, 16 GB of memory, and 512 GB of storage.

Game Pass Ultimate combines Xbox Live Gold with Game Pass. That means you get access to online multiplayer plus their large, Netflix-style catalog of new and old games to download and play. It&#x27;s a service we especially like for those who play a lot of games on PC or Xbox One. Right now, you can snag a three-month subscription for only $25 from around $40. We saw an impressive $1 deal for a one-month membership back in April, but this price matches the low we&#x27;ve seen so far for a three-month subscription.</p></div></div><div class="_75faa6a1"><div

While this is a decent deal for the matte black option, the walnut sees relatively frequent drops, so you might want to hold off for something better (which could well arrive during Prime Day or Black Friday) if that finish appeals to you more. This stylish and compact retro speaker offers great sound in a simple package, perfect for those seeking quality speakers in their home without having to grapple with more complex and expensive setups.

Normally around $225, Away is hosting a site-wide sale right now that knocks down the standard colors of this case to $157. Newer colors are also available for 15 percent off and some older, final sale colors are available for up to 50 percent off.</p></div></div><div class="_75faa6a1"><div class="_52733d64"><p

from Jabra&#x27;s Newegg storefront with a 180-day manufacturer&#x27;s warranty. We think our current top pick (the Elite 75t) is an upgrade in nearly every respect, but they&#x27;re significantly more expensive than this refurb deal. If you&#x27;re looking for some premium wireless earbuds for less than the price of our budget pick and don&#x27;t mind buying refurbished, don&#x27;t miss out on this deal.</p></div></div><div

&quot;the most well-rounded, capable tool of its kind.&quot; It combines handy storage, a comfortable grip, and smooth ratcheting action into a single impressive tool. Although it&#x27;s a little pricier than your run-of-the-mill screwdriver, it&#x27;s effective enough to potentially be the last one you ever have to buy. We&#x27;ve seen a couple deals this year for the MegaPro, but this drop to $23 is still a decent savings on an extremely durable and versatile pick.</p></div></div><div class="_75faa6a1"><div class="_52733d64"><p class="_5161cd56">Read the review</p><a class="a23a2cb0" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-screwdriver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="ignore">The Best Multi-Bit Screwdriver</a></div><div class="e8c1c6c5"><time class="_2a25091e">Posted <!-- -->1 day ago</time><a class="_556fa219" data-gtm-trigger="ignore">Copy link<!-- --> <button class="df536f91"><svg width="13" height="13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M3.25 13c.868 0 1.684-.338 2.297-.951l1.157-1.157a.606.606 0 0 0 0-.862.606.606 0 0 0-.861 0l-1.157 1.157a2.018 2.018 0 0 1-1.436.595A2.034 2.034 0 0 1 1.22 9.75c0-.542.21-1.052.594-1.436L4.25 5.876a2.028 2.028 0 0 1 3.147.344c.09.14.23.232.382.266s.317.01.46-.082a.61.61 0 0 0 .184-.842 3.238 3.238 0 0 0-2.737-1.499c-.868 0-1.685.337-2.297.951L.953 7.453A3.224 3.224 0 0 0 0 9.75 3.254 3.254 0 0 0 3.25 13m4.063-4.062c.868 0 1.685-.338 2.298-.952l2.437-2.438c.614-.614.952-1.43.952-2.298A3.254 3.254 0 0 0 9.75 0c-.868 0-1.684.338-2.297.953L6.296 2.109a.611.611 0 0 0 .42 1.04.61.61 0 0 0 .441-.179l1.157-1.156a2.034 2.034 0 0 1 3.468 1.436 2.02 2.02 0 0 1-.596 1.437L8.75 7.124a2.016 2.016 0 0 1-1.436.595c-.694 0-1.333-.35-1.71-.938a.606.606 0 0 0-.842-.185.607.607 0 0 0-.184.842 3.239 3.239 0 0 0 2.736 1.5" fill="#000" fill-rule="evenodd" class="cf7aeaaf"></path></svg></button><div class="f3407dea">Link Copied!</div><input type="text" class="babd8b87" value="168055" readonly=""/></a></div></div></li><li class="_2f290138" id="deal-168046" data-gtm-element="event_deal"><div style="display:none" data-arachne="slc_edit_archival_link"><a href="https://thewirecutter.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=168046&amp;action=edit" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="ignore" rel="nofollow">Edit</a></div><div class="_17561540"></div><a data-dealcategory="home-garden" data-dealcurrency="USD" data-dealid="168046" data-dealname="Eufy Security Video Doorbell" data-dealvalue="110" data-gtm-trigger="deal_image" data-store="Amazon" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B07R3WY95C?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=edtestzz33716&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image" style="padding-bottom:66.67%"><img class="_612a0221 adccbe5e _64ea2bfb" src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eufy-330x220.png" data-src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eufy-570x380.png" data-srcset="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eufy-570x380.png 570w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eufy-330x220.png 330w" data-sizes="(min-width: 768px) 330px, (min-width: 480px) 630px, 330px" alt="Eufy Security Video Doorbell" itemProp="image" role="presentation"/></figure></a><div class="_67708427"><p class="_1c6c61bf">Runner-up</p><h2 class="_5aa9756d"><a class="product-link" data-dealcategory="home-garden" data-dealcurrency="USD" data-dealid="168046" data-dealname="Eufy Security Video Doorbell" data-dealvalue="110" data-gtm-trigger="deal_title" data-store="Amazon" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B07R3WY95C?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=edtestzz33716&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eufy Security Video Doorbell</a></h2><p class="b4b756a7">$110<!-- --> <del class="c131de93">$150</del><span class="ee1c4c51"> Save <!-- -->$40</span></p><ul class="_3a5ce760"><li class="b48c01b9"><a class="product-link" data-dealcategory="home-garden" data-dealcurrency="USD" data-dealid="168046" data-dealname="Eufy Security Video Doorbell" data-dealvalue="110" data-gtm-trigger="deal_buy_button" data-store="Amazon" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B07R3WY95C?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=edtestzz33716&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Buy from <!-- -->Amazon</a> <span class="_0e4dbee8">Use promo code DOORBELL99 and clip on-page coupon</span></li></ul><div class="_831c3f47" data-gtm-trigger="ignore"><p>Down to $110 when you clip the on-page coupon and use code <strong>DOORBELL99</strong>, this is a fantastic deal on our runner-up pick for best smart doorbell camera.

sides of our heads. Fortunately because of its on-ear design, the Solo Pro doesn’t rest on the arms of your spectacles and pinch your noggin. The Solo Pro also features solid noise-cancellation (though not as good as the Bose 700), and a great sounding pass-through mode that doesn&#x27;t sound tinny like many other offers.  The red, dark blue, and light blue are presently the only color options available at the all time low deal price of $200.</p></div></div><div class="_75faa6a1"><div class="_52733d64"><p class="_5161cd56">Read the

start gearing up for cooler weather. Available for $56 in watermelon and wave blue stripe, this deal offers a decent drop for the thermal underwear pick we like for long, active days outside. We praise the Smartwool Merino 150 for its comfortable fit and variety of lighter colors that make it an ideal option for those planning to spend a lot of time outside in sunny weather. We saw a better deal in late April, but only for last-season clearance colors. Marlin blue is also on sale, but sizing is limited and you&#x27;ll have to pay for shipping unless you reach the $50 shipping threshold.</p></div></div><div class="_75faa6a1"><div class="_52733d64"><p class="_5161cd56">Read the review</p><a class="a23a2cb0" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/reviews/best-mens-base-layers-and-thermal-underwear/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="ignore">The Best Thermal Underwear for Women and Men</a></div><div class="e8c1c6c5"><time class="_2a25091e">Posted <!-- -->2 days ago</time><a class="_556fa219" data-gtm-trigger="ignore">Copy link<!-- --> <button class="df536f91"><svg width="13" height="13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M3.25 13c.868 0 1.684-.338 2.297-.951l1.157-1.157a.606.606 0 0 0 0-.862.606.606 0 0 0-.861 0l-1.157 1.157a2.018 2.018 0 0 1-1.436.595A2.034 2.034 0 0 1 1.22 9.75c0-.542.21-1.052.594-1.436L4.25 5.876a2.028 2.028 0 0 1 3.147.344c.09.14.23.232.382.266s.317.01.46-.082a.61.61 0 0 0 .184-.842 3.238 3.238 0 0 0-2.737-1.499c-.868 0-1.685.337-2.297.951L.953 7.453A3.224 3.224 0 0 0 0 9.75 3.254 3.254 0 0 0 3.25 13m4.063-4.062c.868 0 1.685-.338 2.298-.952l2.437-2.438c.614-.614.952-1.43.952-2.298A3.254 3.254 0 0 0 9.75 0c-.868 0-1.684.338-2.297.953L6.296 2.109a.611.611 0 0 0 .42 1.04.61.61 0 0 0 .441-.179l1.157-1.156a2.034 2.034 0 0 1 3.468 1.436 2.02 2.02 0 0 1-.596 1.437L8.75 7.124a2.016 2.016 0 0 1-1.436.595c-.694 0-1.333-.35-1.71-.938a.606.606 0 0 0-.842-.185.607.607 0 0 0-.184.842 3.239 3.239 0 0 0 2.736 1.5" fill="#000" fill-rule="evenodd" class="cf7aeaaf"></path></svg></button><div class="f3407dea">Link Copied!</div><input type="text" class="babd8b87" value="167931" readonly=""/></a></div></div></li><li class="_2f290138" id="deal-167893" data-gtm-element="event_deal"><div style="display:none" data-arachne="slc_edit_archival_link"><a href="https://thewirecutter.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=167893&amp;action=edit" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="ignore" rel="nofollow">Edit</a></div><div class="_17561540"></div><a data-dealcategory="office" data-dealcurrency="USD" data-dealid="167893" data-dealname="Pentel Sharp Kerry Mechanical Pencil 0.5 mm" data-dealvalue="8" data-gtm-trigger="deal_image" data-store="Amazon" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0006SW6YO?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=edtestzz47&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image" style="padding-bottom:66.67%"><img class="_612a0221 adccbe5e _64ea2bfb" src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pentel-Sharp-Kerry-Mechanical-Pencil--330x220.jpg" data-src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pentel-Sharp-Kerry-Mechanical-Pencil--570x380.jpg" data-srcset="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pentel-Sharp-Kerry-Mechanical-Pencil--570x380.jpg 570w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pentel-Sharp-Kerry-Mechanical-Pencil--330x220.jpg 330w" data-sizes="(min-width: 768px) 330px, (min-width: 480px) 630px, 330px" alt="Pentel Sharp Kerry Mechanical Pencil 0.5 mm" itemProp="image" role="presentation"/></figure></a><div class="_67708427"><p class="_1c6c61bf">notable competition</p><h2 class="_5aa9756d"><a class="product-link" data-dealcategory="office" data-dealcurrency="USD" data-dealid="167893" data-dealname="Pentel Sharp Kerry Mechanical Pencil 0.5 mm" data-dealvalue="8" data-gtm-trigger="deal_title" data-store="Amazon" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0006SW6YO?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=edtestzz47&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pentel Sharp Kerry Mechanical Pencil 0.5 mm</a></h2><p class="b4b756a7">$8<!-- --> <del class="c131de93">$10</del><span class="ee1c4c51"> Save <!-- -->$2</span></p><ul class="_3a5ce760"><li class="b48c01b9"><a class="product-link" data-dealcategory="office" data-dealcurrency="USD" data-dealid="167893" data-dealname="Pentel Sharp Kerry Mechanical Pencil 0.5 mm" data-dealvalue="8" data-gtm-trigger="deal_buy_button" data-store="Amazon" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0006SW6YO?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=edtestzz47&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Buy from <!-- -->Amazon</a> </li></ul><div class="_831c3f47" data-gtm-trigger="ignore"><p>A great deal and only the second time we&#x27;ve seen it on sale, the Pentel Sharp Kerry is back down to $8. Capable of being covered by a cap when not in use, this former pick (now a notable competition option) offers a comfortable body that is friendly to both right -and left-handed users. With its design evoking that of a pen, this mechanical pencil uses refillable 0.5 mm graphite for a sharp line quality.

Although its speed is comparable to our 15- and 16-inch MacBook Pro charger pick, the additional port and smaller size make it a worthy option—particularly if size and efficiency are your main priorities.</p></div></div><div class="_75faa6a1"><div class="_52733d64"><p class="_5161cd56">Read the review</p><a class="a23a2cb0" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/reviews/best-usb-c-macbook-and-laptop-chargers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="ignore">The Best USB-C Laptop and Tablet Chargers</a></div><div class="e8c1c6c5"><time class="_2a25091e">Posted <!-- -->2 days ago</time><a class="_556fa219" data-gtm-trigger="ignore">Copy link<!-- --> <button class="df536f91"><svg width="13" height="13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M3.25 13c.868 0 1.684-.338 2.297-.951l1.157-1.157a.606.606 0 0 0 0-.862.606.606 0 0 0-.861 0l-1.157 1.157a2.018 2.018 0 0 1-1.436.595A2.034 2.034 0 0 1 1.22 9.75c0-.542.21-1.052.594-1.436L4.25 5.876a2.028 2.028 0 0 1 3.147.344c.09.14.23.232.382.266s.317.01.46-.082a.61.61 0 0 0 .184-.842 3.238 3.238 0 0 0-2.737-1.499c-.868 0-1.685.337-2.297.951L.953 7.453A3.224 3.224 0 0 0 0 9.75 3.254 3.254 0 0 0 3.25 13m4.063-4.062c.868 0 1.685-.338 2.298-.952l2.437-2.438c.614-.614.952-1.43.952-2.298A3.254 3.254 0 0 0 9.75 0c-.868 0-1.684.338-2.297.953L6.296 2.109a.611.611 0 0 0 .42 1.04.61.61 0 0 0 .441-.179l1.157-1.156a2.034 2.034 0 0 1 3.468 1.436 2.02 2.02 0 0 1-.596 1.437L8.75 7.124a2.016 2.016 0 0 1-1.436.595c-.694 0-1.333-.35-1.71-.938a.606.606 0 0 0-.842-.185.607.607 0 0 0-.184.842 3.239 3.239 0 0 0 2.736 1.5" fill="#000" fill-rule="evenodd" class="cf7aeaaf"></path></svg></button><div class="f3407dea">Link Copied!</div><input type="text" class="babd8b87" value="166290" readonly=""/></a></div></div></li><li class="_2f290138" id="deal-167884" data-gtm-element="event_deal"><div style="display:none" data-arachne="slc_edit_archival_link"><a href="https://thewirecutter.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=167884&amp;action=edit" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="ignore" rel="nofollow">Edit</a></div><div class="_17561540"></div><a data-dealcategory="appliances" data-dealcurrency="USD" data-dealid="167884" data-dealname="Eufy RoboVac 11S Robot Vacuum" data-dealvalue="160" data-gtm-trigger="deal_image" data-store="Amazon" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B079QYYGF1?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=edtestzz27003" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image" style="padding-bottom:66.67%"><img class="_612a0221 adccbe5e _64ea2bfb" src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Eufy-Robovac-Max-11s-Robot-Vacuum-330x220.jpg" data-src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Eufy-Robovac-Max-11s-Robot-Vacuum-570x380.jpg" data-srcset="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Eufy-Robovac-Max-11s-Robot-Vacuum-570x380.jpg 570w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Eufy-Robovac-Max-11s-Robot-Vacuum-330x220.jpg 330w" data-sizes="(min-width: 768px) 330px, (min-width: 480px) 630px, 330px" alt="Eufy RoboVac 11S Robot Vacuum" itemProp="image" role="presentation"/></figure></a><div class="_67708427"><p class="_1c6c61bf">Budget pick</p><h2 class="_5aa9756d"><a class="product-link" data-dealcategory="appliances" data-dealcurrency="USD" data-dealid="167884" data-dealname="Eufy RoboVac 11S Robot Vacuum" data-dealvalue="160" data-gtm-trigger="deal_title" data-store="Amazon" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B079QYYGF1?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=edtestzz27003" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eufy RoboVac 11S Robot Vacuum</a></h2><p class="b4b756a7">$160<!-- --> <del class="c131de93">$220</del><span class="ee1c4c51"> Save <!-- -->$60</span></p><ul class="_3a5ce760"><li class="b48c01b9"><a class="product-link" data-dealcategory="appliances" data-dealcurrency="USD" data-dealid="167884" data-dealname="Eufy RoboVac 11S Robot Vacuum" data-dealvalue="160" data-gtm-trigger="deal_buy_button" data-store="Amazon" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B079QYYGF1?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=edtestzz27003" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Buy from <!-- -->Amazon</a> </li></ul><div class="_831c3f47" data-gtm-trigger="ignore"><p>Back on sale, you can grab our budget robot vacuum pick for $160 in black. The Eufy RoboVac 11S is an affordable, efficient, and quiet model. Although it&#x27;s not ideal for plush, thick rugs, we found its slim profile was able fit under more furniture than the rest of our other picks. It&#x27;s not as durable as a Roomba and lacks the ability to have major components switched out for repairs, but it&#x27;s much cheaper and also significantly quieter. This deal is $10 more than the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen, but it&#x27;s still another great drop from the $220 street price.</p></div></div><div class="_75faa6a1"><div class="_52733d64"><p class="_5161cd56">Read the review</p><a class="a23a2cb0" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/reviews/best-robot-vacuum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="ignore">The Best Robot Vacuums</a></div><div class="e8c1c6c5"><time class="_2a25091e">Posted <!-- -->2 days ago</time><a class="_556fa219" data-gtm-trigger="ignore">Copy link<!-- --> <button class="df536f91"><svg width="13" height="13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M3.25 13c.868 0 1.684-.338 2.297-.951l1.157-1.157a.606.606 0 0 0 0-.862.606.606 0 0 0-.861 0l-1.157 1.157a2.018 2.018 0 0 1-1.436.595A2.034 2.034 0 0 1 1.22 9.75c0-.542.21-1.052.594-1.436L4.25 5.876a2.028 2.028 0 0 1 3.147.344c.09.14.23.232.382.266s.317.01.46-.082a.61.61 0 0 0 .184-.842 3.238 3.238 0 0 0-2.737-1.499c-.868 0-1.685.337-2.297.951L.953 7.453A3.224 3.224 0 0 0 0 9.75 3.254 3.254 0 0 0 3.25 13m4.063-4.062c.868 0 1.685-.338 2.298-.952l2.437-2.438c.614-.614.952-1.43.952-2.298A3.254 3.254 0 0 0 9.75 0c-.868 0-1.684.338-2.297.953L6.296 2.109a.611.611 0 0 0 .42 1.04.61.61 0 0 0 .441-.179l1.157-1.156a2.034 2.034 0 0 1 3.468 1.436 2.02 2.02 0 0 1-.596 1.437L8.75 7.124a2.016 2.016 0 0 1-1.436.595c-.694 0-1.333-.35-1.71-.938a.606.606 0 0 0-.842-.185.607.607 0 0 0-.184.842 3.239 3.239 0 0 0 2.736 1.5" fill="#000" fill-rule="evenodd" class="cf7aeaaf"></path></svg></button><div class="f3407dea">Link Copied!</div><input type="text" class="babd8b87" value="167884" readonly=""/></a></div></div></li></ul></div></article></div></main><footer class="d782f6aa" role="contentinfo"><div id="js-site-footer" class="_5cd9fcb6"><div class="eb6cd63d"><nav id="footer-categories-container"><ul id="footer-categories" class="_8613263d _5bfca36f"><li class="d74fcd99 menuItemTypeTaxonomy menuItemObjectAuxiliarySection"><a href="/wirecutter/electronics/" class="a9dd9c2a c6313bf7">Electronics</a></li><li class="d74fcd99 menuItemTypeTaxonomy menuItemObjectAuxiliarySection"><a href="/wirecutter/home-garden/" class="a9dd9c2a c6313bf7">Home &amp;
