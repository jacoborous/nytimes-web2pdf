    After 30 hours of research and a test of 17 baby bottles, we think
    the [Lansinoh mOmma
    Bottle](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/24488/0/4/70051/)
    is the one to try
    first.

    We spent over 250 hours testing 15 wraps, slings, and meh dais, and
    found that the [Solly Baby
    Wrap](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/24454/164603/4/69976/?merchant=Nordstrom)
    and [Sakura Bloom Basics
    Sling](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/24455/130270/4/69980/?merchant=Sakura%20Bloom)
    are the best for most
