<div class="css-53u6y8">

The New England Patriots were down 20-10 early in the fourth quarter of
Sunday’s A.F.C. Championship game. Little had worked for the Patriots
all day, but like Tom Brady has so many times over the years, the
40-year-old quarterback kept his cool and led the Patriots to a 24-20
victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It would have been shocking for
any other team and quarterback, but seemed par for the course in this
case.

With the win, Brady will go to the [Super
Bowl](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/04/sports/super-bowl-patriots-eagles.html)
for the eighth time in his 18-year career, and he will be in search of
his sixth career championship. The Patriots will face the winner of
Sunday night’s [N.F.C. Championship
game](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/21/sports/nfc-championship-vikings-eagles.html)
between the Minnesota Vikings and the Philadelphia Eagles.

For the Jaguars to get so close only to fall apart after a
Cinderella-like season seemed especially cruel, with Blake Bortles
outplaying Brady for much of the game only to have New England make some
tremendous second-half adjustments that essentially eliminated
Jacksonville’s offense from the game.

New England and Brady survived losing their top receiver, Rob
Gronkowski, to a concussion in the first half on a brutal
helmet-to-helmet collision with Jacksonville’s hard-hitting safety Barry
Church. Gronkowski came up from the hit looking disoriented and was
immediately taken to the locker room for evaluation, being ruled out for
the rest of the game shortly after.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Brady ended up completing 26 of 38 passes for 290 yards and two
touchdowns on the day, helping his team survive against one of the
N.F.L.’s top defensive units. Bortles was nearly as good, completing 23
of 36 for 293 with one touchdown, but with Leonard Fournette unable to
provide much in the way of a rushing attack, New England was able to
attack Bortles far more aggressively as the game progressed, and that
seemed to provide the difference.

In an on-field interview with CBS after the game, Brady discussed the
hand injury that had dominated the conversation before the game.

“I’ve had a lot worse,” Brady said. “I didn’t know that on Wednesday, it
was a crazy injury.” He added, “Today we did just enough to win.”

On going to the Super Bowl again: “It’s pretty crazy. It’s pretty
amazing. To be on a team that wins these kids of games is a great
accomplishment.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Bortles was given one final try late in the fourth quarter to regain the
lead, but a fourth-down pass fell incomplete and a despondent Bortles
lay on the field trying to figure out how the game had slipped away.

The Patriots’ top receiver for most of the game was Brandin Cooks, a
deep threat who caught 6 passes for 100 yards, but it was Danny Amendola
who took over in the fourth quarter, catching two touchdowns from Brady
to erase Jacksonville’s lead. Amendola finished the game with 7 catches
for 84 yards.

Here’s how the Patriots beat the Jaguars in the A.F.C. Championship
game:

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Patriots’ first drive ends with a field goal.

New England is up 3-0 after a drive that showed some serious promise
before fizzling out in the red zone.

The Patriots got the ball first and Tom Brady immediately completed a
5-yard pass to Dion Lewis and a 31-yarder to Brandin Cooks. The offense
then managed just 8 yards on three short plays — a short run by Brady, a
reverse to Rex Burkhead and a short completion to Burkhead — before
aggressively going for it on 4th-and-2 with Brady tossing a high floater
of a pass that somehow found its way into Danny Amendola’s hands for a
20-yard gain, putting the Patriots in the red zone.

Jacksonville then tightened things up considerably, and a sack on
3rd-and-goal from the 12-yard line forced New England to send Stephen
Gostkowski in for the 31-yard kick.

Despite having a stitched-up hand that was the subject of a great deal
of speculation, Brady looked perfectly comfortable on the opening drive,
completing all six of his passes for 57 yards.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Dropped passes hurt Jaguars as drive stalls out.

The Jaguars stayed true to their style of football on their opening
drive, running the ball and going for conservative passes, but a pair of
dropped balls resulted in them punting away the ball after picking up 23
yards.

Jacksonville started the drive from their own 26-yard line and they
alternated between runs up the middle by Leonard Fournette and passes by
Blake Bortles, which were on their mark even if they lacked much zip on
them.

But after picking up two quick first downs, the Jaguars stalled thanks
to a badly dropped pass by T.J. Yeldon on 2nd-and-8 from the
Jacksonville 49-yard line, and a more difficult drop from Marqise Lee on
3rd-and-8.

Often mocked, the Jaguars succeeded this season by executing their game
plan each and every week. Dropping easy passes that Bortles threw
accurately could be a major
problem.

## Jaguars grab the lead after a balanced drive.

The Jaguars defense produced a quick three-and-out, and given another
chance on offense, Jacksonville was far more aggressive. The change in
strategy paid off with a smooth-as-butter 76-yard drive that ended with
a 4-yard touchdown pass from Blake Bortles to Marcedes Lewis. With the
extra-point, the Jaguars are now on top 7-3.

Once they got the ball back, the Jaguars went to work immediately with a
20-yard catch-and-run by Corey Grant. They then had a series of solid
gains with a 7-yard pass from Blake Bortles to Marqise Lee, a pair of
runs by Leonard Fournette that combined for 10 yards, and a nice pass by
Bortles that found Keelan Cole on the sideline for an 11-yard gain.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The first quarter ended after Cole’s reception, but after changing sides
of the field, the Jaguars picked up right where they left off with
another impressive catch-and-run by Grant that went for 24 yards.

Set up with a 1st-and-goal at the New England 4-yard line, everyone was
expecting a Fournette run up the middle, but Bortles faked to his power
back before lofting a pass over the right side of the line for the Lewis
touchdown.

## Fournette gives Jaguars a 14-3 lead in first half.

Leonard Fournette barreled into the end zone for a 4-yard touchdown and
the Jaguars, against all odds, are leading 14-3 in a game that is going
exactly as they had hoped.

The Jacksonville defense did its part by following up the team’s first
touchdown by continuing to suffocate New England’s offense. Tom Brady
has completed just 1 of 3 passes since his 6-for-6 start, and the
Patriots have resorted to punts on consecutive drives.

After New England’s second punt, Bortles and the Jaguars took over at
their own 23-yard line and through a combination of Fournette, Corey
Grant, and a beautiful 27-yard completion to Allen Hurns, they found
themselves with yet another 1st-and-goal.

This time instead of using Fournette as a decoy, they just gave the ball
to the huge rookie running back and let him take care of the scoring by
himself. His injured ankle does not appear to be limiting him thus far
as he has 38 yards on 9 carries despite a defense that seems designed to
try to take him out of the game.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Jaguars threaten again, but Pats’ defense holds.

The Jaguars had everything going their way, with touchdowns on
consecutive drives and a third chance to score thanks to a miracle
26-yard reception by Keelan Cole that extended the drive. But a penalty
pushed them out of scoring range, a sack forced them into a punt, and
Jacksonville gave the ball back to Tom Brady and the Patriots with just
over two minutes left in the half. An 11-point lead feels comfortable,
but if the Patriots can narrow that to four points before halftime, the
makeup of the entire game would be dramatically different.

## Jaguars’ mistakes give Patriots some relief.

As they have so many times, Tom Brady and the Patriots’ offense willed
the team back into contention in a game that seemed to be slipping away.
A pair of gigantic penalties against the Jaguars defense provided most
of the yardage, but James White took care of the scoring with a 1-yard
run that narrowed Jacksonville’s lead to 14-10. Unfortunately for the
Patriots, they may have lost Rob Gronkowski in the process.

New England got a strong start to the drive with Brady finding Brandin
Cooks for a 10-yard gain. Short passes to Danny Amendola and James White
picked up a second first down, and the Patriots got 15 yards by way of
an unnecessary roughness call against Barry Church for going
helmet-to-helmet on a collision with Gronkowski. The hit sent Gronkowski
off the field so he could be evaluated for a concussion, potentially
ending his day, but the Patriots immediately picked up another 32 yards
on a pass interference call against A.J. Bouye, setting them up to score
on the 85-yard drive that took just 67 seconds off the game clock.

Closing the gap, especially with Jacksonville getting the ball to start
the second half, was a huge development for New England, but
Gronkowski’s status going forward could determine the outcome of this
game.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Halftime: Jaguars have the lead, but not the momentum.

At halftime, the Jaguars are on top 14-10, but they ceded much of the
momentum of the game by letting the Patriots sneak in a score in the
final minute of the first half, thanks largely to penalties.

The Jaguars’ offense got the ball one more time, and despite having a
pair of timeouts and 55 seconds left, they stuck to a conservative game
plan and knelt on the ball for two plays to ensure that they went into
the locker room with a lead.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Jacksonville will get the ball to start the second half, which could let
them regain some momentum, but the Patriots are known for second-half
adjustments so it could be considerably more difficult for Jacksonville
regardless of Rob Gronkowski’s status.

## Jaguars open second half with a field goal.

Blake Bortles was as close to perfect as he gets in the first half,
completing 13 of 15 passes for 155 yards and a touchdown. But after
stretching his streak of consecutive completions to 12 to open the
second half, he had a ball knocked to the ground on a 3rd down pass
attempt, resulting in Jacksonville sending Josh Lambo out for a 54-yard
field goal attempt that he sent right through the uprights for a 17-10
lead.

Jacksonville did not stray from what typically works for them on the
drive, with Leonard Fournette running the ball several times and Tommy
Bohanon, the team’s fullback, contributing a solid 20-yard
catch-and-run.

The Jaguars got some bad news on the scoring drive when Cam Robinson, a
rookie who starts at left tackle, was removed from the game with a
shoulder injury. He is listed as questionable to
return.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## With Gronkowski sidelined, Patriots stumble.

Still without Rob Gronkowski, who is being evaluated for a concussion
and is listed as questionable to return, the Patriots started the second
half out of sync. A pair of deep passes from Brady to Brandin Cooks went
for nothing thanks to fantastic coverage on one play and a drop by Cooks
on the second, and the drive ended with New England punting the ball
away.

## Jaguars build 10-point lead in fourth quarter.

It briefly looked like New England had made some terrific second-half
adjustments to limit Blake Bortles’s effectiveness, but the Jaguars’
quarterback made some adjustments of his own. Jacksonville picked up 66
yards on 11 plays, setting Josh Lambo up for a 43-yard field goal that
increased Jacksonville’s lead to 20-10.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The teams traded punts, with the battle of field position resulting in
Jacksonville starting its latest drive from the team’s own 9-yard line.
But a pair of runs by Leonard Fournette generated 7 yards, and that
generated enough cushion for Bortles to pick up a first down with an
18-yard pass to Marqise Lee.

Bortles picked up two more first downs with passes to Allen Hurns and
Lee, the first of which came on a flea flicker, and then Fournette
rumbled for 14 yards on the ground.

The next two plays went nowhere, closing out the third quarter, and the
fourth quarter began with Jacksonville facing a 3rd-and-8 from New
England’s 25-yard line. Bortles threw an incomplete pass, but the
Jaguars had gone far enough to set up Lambo’s kick.

## Patriots will have to come back without Gronkowski.

Rob Gronkowski is officially out for the remainder of the game with a
concussion, which will continue to limit New England’s offense as they
start their first possession of the fourth quarter down 20-10.

## Jaguars force a huge fumble to thwart Patriots’ drive.

The Jaguars got a huge break when a 22-yard gain by the Patriots ended
with Myles Jack jarring the ball out of Dion Lewis’s hands for a fumble
and a recovery, giving Jacksonville’s offense a chance to extend its
lead. Tom Brady had picked up a quick first down with an 18-yard pass to
Brandin Cooks, and then the Patriots appeared to have a huge gain on a
trick play that involved a short pass from Brady to Danny Amendola who
then threw across the field to Lewis. Lewis rumbled for big yardage, but
then Jack simply stole the ball out of his hands, and the call stood up
to a review by officials for the first turnover of the
game.

Repeatedly throwing deep down field, Tom Brady and the Patriots showed

it a 20-17 game.

The Patriots dodged a bullet on their previous drive when a fumble by

the ball back on his own 15-yard line, and as so many teams have found
out over the years, the more opportunities you give Brady, the worse off
your team tends to be.

The 40-year-old quarterback, who was supposed to be limited by an
injured hand, endured a sack by Marcell Dareus on the drive, but looked
spry and aggressive, challenging Jacksonville’s star-studded secondary
and repeatedly finding success.

Brady has now completed 23 of 32 passes for 263 yards against the most
talented secondary in the N.F.L.

## Patriots grab the lead on Amendola’s circus catch.

It had been a defensive clinic for both teams over the last few drives,
but the Patriots showed why experience is so valuable in the N.F.L. by
taking a 24-20 lead thanks to Danny Amendola’s circus catch in the back
of the end zone. It was Amendola’s second touchdown of the quarter.

The Patriots started the drive on Jacksonville’s 30-yard line after a
series of punts by both teams finally broke New England’s way with a
20-yard return by Danny Amendola giving them a short field.

New England then went into automatic mode, with a series of short runs
and passes pushing the ball into the end zone in a span of 2 minutes and
10 seconds of game clock.

Jacksonville has plenty of time to score, but with New England’s defense
having tightened up considerably, that could be very difficult unless
the Jaguars have something hidden up their collective sleeve.
