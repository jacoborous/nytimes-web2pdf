Race}\label{the-latest-polls-the-great-non-tightening-this-week-in-the-2020-race}}

A wave of data this week suggested that the race was largely holding
steady after the parties' conventions. Will the uproar over President
Trump's reported remarks on the military shake things up?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/us/politics/biden-trump-polling.html}{batch
  of national polls} released in the wake of the Democratic and
  Republican conventions showed Joe Biden leading President Trump by
  anywhere from \textbf{seven to 10 percentage points}.
\item
  A variety of swing-state polls also out this week broadly showed Mr.
  Biden retaining his advantage, though not always by much.
  \href{https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-biden-tops-trump-among-likely-voters-in-key-states}{Fox
  News polls} showed Mr. Biden with a \textbf{nine-point} lead in
  Arizona, an \textbf{eight-point} margin in Wisconsin and a narrower
  \textbf{four-point} edge in North Carolina.
\item
  \href{https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/}{Monmouth
  University surveys} showed North Carolina even closer, with Mr. Biden
  and Mr. Trump separated by just \textbf{two points}, and Mr. Biden up
  by \textbf{four points} in Pennsylvania. (Both of those differences
  were within the polls' margins of error.)
\item
  Mr. Biden
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/02/us/trump-vs-biden\#biden-shatters-fund-raising-records-with-a-364-5-million-haul-in-august}{announced
  raising} \textbf{\$364.5 million in August} with the Democratic Party,
  shattering past monthly fund-raising records. Mr. Trump's campaign has
  not disclosed its August haul.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Biden campaign also said it was spending \textbf{\$45 million} on
  digital and television ads this week, by far its biggest outlay of the
  campaign to date, including its first ad
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/us/politics/biden-ads-trump.html}{to
  respond to Mr. Trump's attack} over law and order.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{catch-me-up}{%
\subsection{Catch me up}\label{catch-me-up}}

If there was any week where President Trump's campaign might have
expected an increase in polling, it was this one. Mr. Trump and
Republicans were coming out of their nominating convention, a four-day
event that cast re-electing the president as a moral emergency. And
after a police shooting in Kenosha, Wis., led to a wave of unrest, Mr.
Trump sought to seize on the chaos to promote his ``law and order''
message and energize his conservative base.

And yet, in a week of polling that provided the clearest electoral
picture since the conventions, the evidence pointed to a steady race.
The great electoral tightening, feared by Democrats and anticipated by
Republicans, has yet to manifest: Mr. Trump didn't manage to pull even
with Mr. Biden in any swing-state poll. And in a Fox News poll of
Wisconsin, it was Mr. Biden --- not Mr. Trump --- who had an edge in the
question about trustworthiness regarding policing and criminal justice.

support}\label{a-potential-risk-to-trumps-military-support}}

The White House and the Biden campaign reacted with unusual velocity on
Thursday night after
\href{https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/}{The
Atlantic published an article}, citing four unnamed sources, that said
Mr. Trump had referred to American soldiers killed in combat during
World War I as ``losers'' and ``suckers.''

Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, visited reporters
traveling aboard Air Force One to Pennsylvania to assure them that the
story was false. Upon landing, a visibly angry Mr. Trump marched over to
the reporters and denied the story himself, excoriating the writer and
sources as ``lowlifes'' and ``liars.''

The Biden campaign immediately organized a call with Senator Tammy
Duckworth of Illinois and Representative Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania,
both veterans, and Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father who spoke at the
Democratic National Convention in 2016, to denounce the president's
comments.

On Friday, Mr. Biden
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/us/politics/biden-trump-soliders-insults.html}{called
the report} ``disgusting,'' while Mr. Trump
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/us/politics/trump-veterans-losers.html}{repeated
his assertion} that it was ``fake.''

The swift responses from both sides show how both campaigns thought the
story could jeopardize Mr. Trump's support from the military just two
months before an election. Will it?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{It helps Mr. Trump that the sources chose to remain
  anonymous.} That has left Mr. Biden having to address the story with a
  caveat, ``If these statements are true,'' and allows Mr. Trump to cast
  doubt on a report that some former officials said they believed
  because it was in line with his general view of military service.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Nothing sticks.} On the campaign trail four years ago, Mr.
  Trump horrified many fellow Republicans when he insulted Senator John
  McCain, the former prisoner of war, by saying, ``I like people who
  weren't captured.'' In the grand scheme, the comment hurt him not at
  all, and seems positively tame compared with what has come since then.
\item
  \textbf{But Mr. Trump is already struggling with military support ---
  and the entire election will be a game at the margins.} Polling
  suggests
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/us/politics/trump-military-vote-democrats.html}{Mr.
  Trump's popularity has slipped} among active-duty troops. If
  Republicans have been impressed with the president's recent
  law-and-order message, his purported private disgust for the military
  threatens to undermine the message that Mr. Trump stands with American
  men and women in uniform.

Wis., on Thursday.Credit...Kriston Jae Bethel for The New York Times

After months of trying to project caution about coronavirus safety
measures, Mr. Biden and some of his surrogates are (cautiously) hitting
the road again.

It started this week in Kenosha, Wis., where
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/us/politics/joe-biden-kenosha.html}{Mr.
Biden held a listening session} that brought together police officers,
racial justice activists, civic leaders and business owners in a
conversation about healing and racial equity. Timing his trip just days
after
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/01/us/trump-vs-biden}{Mr.
Trump visited Kenosha} and focused on vandalism and looting, it was
clear that Mr. Biden wanted to project what he thought a presidential
visit should look like.

The visit had the side benefit of neutralizing an infamous argument
about Wisconsin from 2016, when the Democratic presidential nominee,
Hillary Clinton, did not visit the state during the general election
campaign and lost there by fewer than 23,000 votes.

In the days since Mr. Biden's visit to Kenosha, his campaign has
announced new events in Delaware, Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania.
Based on conversations with Democratic advisers, and the campaign's
recent virtual events, here's what to expect:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{A focus on the pandemic, and Mr. Trump's failures.} The Biden
  campaign believes the pandemic response has all the hallmarks of the
  ways that Americans are dissatisfied with Mr. Trump's administration,
  and is a singular issue that has affected every American's life.
  Although Mr. Trump's convention framed his record as one that stopped
  the health crisis from being worse, Mr. Biden will highlight the ways
  the incumbent has ignored experts and public health advice. One
  example: an upcoming trip to Minnesota by Jill Biden, who is embarking
  on a national ``Back-to-School Tour'' as the country grapples with
  reopening procedures.
\item
  \textbf{A catchall strategy on racial equity and protests.} First, the
  Biden campaign debuted a digital advertisement embracing law and order
  and condemning rioting and looting in cities. Then, the campaign
  started running an advertisement titled ``We're Listening,'' in which
  Mr. Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California,
  express sympathy for protesters and outline steps for police reform.
  Though the ideas are not in conflict, they are indicative of Mr.
  Biden's catchall approach when it comes to the current moment of
  racial unrest in the country.
\item
  \textbf{Integrating new reporting on Mr. Trump and veterans.} Few
  reports break through the fire hose of political noise, but the
  Atlantic report captured both campaigns' attention this week. There
  are signs that Mr. Biden's campaign will further integrate the
  controversy into its messaging, including a web video it posted on
  Friday. And Vote Vets, a liberal group of veterans that has endorsed
  Mr. Biden, has already made an advertisement about the issue.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trump encourages supporters to vote twice. Will they take
him
literally?}\label{trump-encourages-supporters-to-vote-twice-will-they-take-him-literally}}

Framing his suggestion as a way to stress-test the security of election
systems,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/us/politics/people-voting-twice-trump.html}{Mr.
Trump this week said} voters in North Carolina should try to vote twice,
once by mail and once in person, to make sure their choice was counted.

Intentionally voting twice is illegal --- an offense that can send you
to jail in some states --- and the comments served as the president's
latest attempt to cast doubt on the integrity of the November election
and set the stage to claim the election was somehow rigged, if he loses.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Mr. Trump makes so many outlandish and vaguely worded statements that
  it makes it easy for his defenders to wave some of them away when he
  is criticized. White House officials said Mr. Trump was only
  encouraging his supporters to verify that their mail-in ballots had
  been counted, and denied that he was encouraging people to vote twice.
\item
  What's not clear yet is whether North Carolina voters took him
  seriously and literally, and whether they will try to break the law as
  the state begins its vote-by-mail process.
\item
  The North Carolina State Board of Elections issued a statement
  reminding people that voting twice is illegal --- the latest reminder
  that living in America under the Trump administration is a daily
  civics lesson.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Voting in Massachusetts went smoothly on Tuesday, with more than 1.6
  million ballots cast and a Democratic Senate primary winner called
  around 10:30 p.m. An emphasis on mail-in voting, a decline in
  coronavirus infection rates and a less heated partisan atmosphere
  helped. Still, the state's harsh mailing deadlines
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/us/politics/massachusetts-election-voting.html}{may
  have disenfranchised some voters}.
\item
  Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa,
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/us/politics/joni-ernst-coronavirus.html}{repeated
  a false claim} that Covid-19 death statistics were being inflated. Her
  Democratic opponent, Theresa Greenfield, accused her of ``peddling
  dangerous conspiracy theories.''
\item
  A new campaign called \#HealTheVote aims to turn out 100,000 crime
  survivors for the coming election. Many survivors have said that
  voting is a way not only to influence policy,
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/us/politics/voting-crime-survivors.html}{but
  also to combat the sense of powerlessness} and violation they felt
  after being attacked.
\end{itemize}
