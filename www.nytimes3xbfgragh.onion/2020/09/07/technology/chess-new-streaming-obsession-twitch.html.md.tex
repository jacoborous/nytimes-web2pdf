Viewers are flocking to games during the pandemic, entranced by a
charismatic grandmaster and his lightning-fast play.

On a recent afternoon, thousands of noncombatants watched from the
sidelines as their general ordered his troops across the battlefield and
became locked in a fierce duel with the enemy.

At one point, he berated himself for a tactical misstep that could have
cost his side the high-stakes conflict. Then he smiled and began
outmaneuvering his foe.

``I can't lose,'' Hikaru Nakamura, 32, said to the exultant onlookers.
Victory seemed close as members of the opposing army were vanquished one
by one. ``I win again --- there you go, guys. Wow.''

Mr. Nakamura gave himself just a moment's respite, then plunged into
another fray. Pawns, knights, bishops and even kings fell before him as
the chess grandmaster demolished a slate of online challengers, all
while narrating the tide of the battle to tens of thousands of fans
watching him stream
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/08/26/technology/amazon-nears-a-deal-for-twitch.html}{live
on Twitch}, the Amazon-owned site where people usually broadcast
themselves playing video games like Fortnite and Call of Duty.

The

pandemic} and stay-at-home orders have crowned a host of unlikely
winners catering to bored audiences. But watching livestreams of chess
games? Could one of the world's oldest and most cerebral games really
rebrand itself as a lively enough pastime to capture the interest of the
masses on Twitch?

Turns out, it already has.

Since the pandemic began, viewership of live chess games has soared.
From March through August, people watched 41.2 million hours of chess on
Twitch, four times as many hours as in the previous six months,
according to the analytics website SullyGnome. In June, an amateur chess
tournament called \href{https://www.twitch.tv/chess}{PogChamps} was
briefly the top-viewed stream on Twitch, with 63,000 people watching at
once, SullyGnome said. And popular Twitch gamers like Félix Lengyel
(better known to his 3.3 million followers as ``xQcOW'') have also
recently started streaming chess.

That collision of the chess audience and the general gamer audience has
created a ``giant chess bonfire,'' said Marcus Graham, Twitch's head of
creator development.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/09/07/business/07twitchchess4/merlin_176593986_628679fc-cc70-4f93-a16a-92a758250ad5-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

The popularity of online chess has partly been fueled by Mr. Nakamura.
Last month, one of the world's top professional video game teams, Team
SoloMid, beat several
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/08/31/technology/esports-explosion-brings-opportunity-riches-for-video-gamers.html}{e-sports
rivals} to sign him to a six-figure contract so it could pair him with
advertisers and merchandise. Mr. Nakamura was one of the first chess
players to join an e-sports team, just a week after a different group
signed a Canadian player, Qiyu Zhou.

Though Mr. Nakamura began streaming chess consistently on his Twitch
channel, \href{https://www.twitch.tv/gmhikaru}{GMHikaru}, in 2018,
nearly all of his 528,000 followers have come aboard since the pandemic
began. And as his popularity has skyrocketed,
\href{https://www.wired.com/story/hikaru-nakamura-twitch-chess/}{media
attention} has increased --- including a
\href{https://www.chess.com/news/view/hikaru-nakamura-billions-showtime}{cameo}as
himself on the television drama ``Billions'' in May.

``It's just amazing to see the level of support and the love that I've
seen from the Twitch community,'' Mr. Nakamura said. He added that the
most appealing part of playing and streaming chess was simply ``the fact
that I'm so good at it.''

It helps that he has an unimpeachable chess pedigree. In 1998, at age
10, he became the youngest player in the United States to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1998/04/11/nyregion/pawns-with-king-size-dreams-boy-10-is-youngest-master-vaulting-past-his-brother.html}{be
named a master,} a title earned through strong performances.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2003/03/02/nyregion/next-generation-a-grand-master-and-he-s-only-15.html}{Five
years later}, he became the youngest U.S. player to graduate to
grandmaster, the highest title. He has since won five national
championships.

On his Twitch channel, Mr. Nakamura, who lives in Los Angeles, rarely
stops talking. His stream of commentary and chatter, even as he directs
his pieces with the precision of an orchestra conductor, is one of the
main reasons fans have flocked to him.

``He draws people because he's so good, but also, there are other top
players on Twitch that are not as engaging as he is, not as funny, not
as in tune with the sort of Twitch culture,'' said Brandon Benton, 34, a
postdoctoral physics researcher at Cornell University who watches Mr.
Nakamura stream. He's a ``down-to-earth memer and jokester.''

If you're picturing a chess match as a drawn-out slog --- well, you're
not wrong. A classical game without time limits can last five hours. But
many online battles, including nearly all the games that Mr. Nakamura
streams, are blitz chess. Each player has just a few minutes to complete
all of his or her moves, leading to an aggressive, risky style of play
that fans say is exhilarating to watch.

A player's timer stops only when it is the other person's turn to move a
piece, so planning ahead and making quick calls is vital to managing the
clock. The climax often comes when mere seconds remain and the
combatants exchange a rapid flurry of moves.

In a recent stream, Mr. Nakamura had fewer pieces left than his opponent
and just 20 seconds remaining. But 41 moves later, he was grinning after
pulling off an improbable checkmate that involved charging a pawn across
the board and hatching it into a queen. It had taken him just 16
seconds.

``More than anything, it's the ability to play extremely high-level
chess and win while I seemingly am not focused on the game and talking
to my chat,'' Mr. Nakamura said of his ability to draw a large audience,
which he usually retains as he plays 20 or more games in one sitting.
``At least at blitz chess, I'm probably the best or second-best player
ever, in the entire history, at least online.''

If Mr. Nakamura is as good as he says --- and he is, judging from his
numerous titles, various international awards and 288 victories in 302
streamed matches --- then it makes sense that chess fans are tuning in.
If Serena Williams and Usain Bolt showed off their unique abilities
every day on a livestream, wouldn't you watch?

Still, chess, to put it kindly, is not quite as visually stimulating as
a tennis match or a 100-meter dash. So what else is part of the secret?

Many devotees at ``Naka's PogUniversity'' --- the name of Mr. Nakamura's
community on Discord, a voice and text chat application --- said they
had been sucked in after rediscovering chess in the past few months
while stuck inside. Many had dabbled in the game as children.

``When I was growing up, high-level chess was secreted behind closed
doors, played by the privileged, moneyed people in society,'' said
Clayton Chan, 43, from Tustin, Calif. ``Realizing that I could see chess
being played at the highest levels and seeing the players on Twitch
communicate their thoughts with the community really resonated with
me.''

Noah Olsen, 24, who lives in Washington, D.C., said he enjoyed how
interactive Mr. Nakamura was with his fans. The grandmaster sometimes
invites his subscribers to play against him on the stream, and he will
start with fewer pieces as a handicap or
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrEX8NNkQ5Y}{play blindfolded}.

``It's definitely a lot of fun to know you're going up against a chess
mind the caliber of Hikaru,'' Mr. Olsen said. ``But the 10,000 people
watching while he dismantles you is a little nerve-racking.''

In Murcia, Spain, Anthony Nicolaou, 16, recently discovered Mr.
Nakamura's channel. That inspired him to rededicate himself to a
longtime goal: to beat his father at chess.

``The most important thing I learned from him is that it's OK to be
bad,'' he said of watching Mr. Nakamura. ``I realized you can still
learn and improve without feeling like an idiot.''

Mr. Nakamura has become a coach for streamers, too. He ranges from
supportive to exasperated with the shortcomings of his protégés. Fans
love when he loses his mind at a poorly thought-out move.

``He makes all sorts of faces,'' Mr. Benton of Cornell said.

The chess fever sweeping Twitch has been a boon for those who make money
streaming the games. Eric Hansen, 28, a grandmaster who streams on the
Twitch channel \href{https://www.twitch.tv/chessbrah}{ChessBrah}, said
he could make six figures a year on the platform through sales of
merchandise, ad sponsorships and subscriber contributions.

Mr. Nakamura said all the attention was a victory for chess.

``I've seen a lot of booms and busts,'' he said. But this time, ``I
don't actually see it tailing off now. I think the future's extremely
bright.''
