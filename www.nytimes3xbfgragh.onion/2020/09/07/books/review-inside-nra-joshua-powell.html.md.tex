This is a sad book, and a bad one, and you shouldn't buy it. The
thinking in it is poor; the writing is worse. The author ``exposes''
evils that, if you've been paying even scant attention, you already
know. Expect it soon in a Walmart remainder bin near you.

To summarize my argument thus far: No.

Joshua L. Powell, the author of ``Inside the NRA: A Tell-All Account of
Corruption, Greed, and Paranoia Within the Most Powerful Political Group
in America,'' is a former Chicago options and derivatives trader. He met
his hero Wayne LaPierre, the sunny rhetorician and National Rifle
Association chief executive, on a duck-hunting trip.

Powell joined the N.R.A.'s board of directors. A couple of years later,
LaPierre asked him to become his chief of staff. Powell writes: ``It was
like having Vince Lombardi say, \emph{Hey, do you want to come help me
coach the Packers}?''

Powell looked the part; in photographs, he resembles the urbane bad guy
in a Nordic thriller. He became the N.R.A.'s senior strategist, the
second in command. He presided there from 2016 until he was pushed out
early this year.

For a time, Powell loved it all --- the cigars, the steakhouses, the
rooms at the Ritz, the Pol Roger Champagne, the flags and the eagles,
the crushing of libtards, the ``oddly intoxicating'' adrenaline spikes
on school-shooting days and the war-room strategizing in their wake.

He liked ``freedom,'' including the ability to open-carry his sidearm in
the office. Maybe someone would make his day. He had thoughts of
succeeding LaPierre, who is 70, as chief executive.

The administrative warfare inside the organization was intense. Powell
began to lose some battles, and felt marginalized. He began to see ---
in the way a writer will notice, when his or her work isn't going well,
that the literary world is broken --- everything that was wrong with the
N.R.A.

Now he's a singing insider in the year of the singing insider, a misfit
chorus performing a cappella around a trash can fire.

Powell's apostasy is the primary news here. He comes out in favor of
minor forms of gun control, things like background checks and so-called
red flag laws and the closing of loopholes around gun show sales. This
counts as fearless speech only in the paranoid and steroidal world of
the N.R.A., which brooks zero dissent.

In ``Hell's Angels,'' Hunter S. Thompson described the motorcycle gang's
``total retaliation ethic.'' Asked to leave a bar, they'd burn it down.
The N.R.A. has a similar ethic when it comes to dealing with
politicians, or anyone else, who disagree with them even on minutiae.

The bulk of this book describes waste and mismanagement. LaPierre is
compared to an absent-minded professor and, in the sense that there's no
there there, the Wizard of Oz.

``The national media thought we were this deep, dark, powerful lobbying
machine, high-tech and streamlined, with tentacles everywhere,'' Powell
writes.

``I had to laugh. It was more like a tuned-out guy sitting in a room
full of other tuned-out guys, saying, \emph{I think I'll put this up on
Facebook today}. Totally random, with zero coordination, zero analysis,
much less a sophisticated tactical approach.''

Powell attacks LaPierre's extremist language, not always because he
disagrees with it (he did little to rein it in) but because it's a bad
look. He bemoans the N.R.A.'s corruption, its grifter culture, in which
he appears to have taken part.

Before he was fired he was accused of improperly charging some \$58,000
in personal expenses to the nonprofit organization. He's also been
accused of nepotism and sexual harassment.

Is this book another grift?
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/us/politics/nra-book-wayne-lapierre.html}{The
New York Times reported that} in the weeks before his firing, he tried
to restructure his contract and sought a \$1.7 million consultant job.
He wrote to LaPierre: ``My loyalty to the association is without
question.''

Powell omits other things. In a book ostensibly about the Second
Amendment, which is all of 27 words long, the words ``well-regulated''
and ``militia'' do not appear.

``Inside the NRA'' reads like a business book, and not a good one. A lot
of jargon gets tossed around. (Powell talks about an ``existing vendor
relationship'' and wanting the N.R.A. to ``become a leader in the
conceal-carry space.'')

The unrelenting barrage of clichés is worse. The N.R.A. has debased the
American language, and Powell adds to the sludge. If you only skimmed
this book, you would think it was about a fox in a henhouse who caught
flak and was thrown under a bus for playing laser-focused hardball like
gangbusters and getting the short end of the stick while sensing blood
in the water.

Powell is unconvincing on nearly every level. He reports the good news
that ``of the 18 million who have concealed weapons permits, only 0.8
percent have committed any serious crimes.'' Whew! Wait. Siri, what is
0.8 percent of 18 million? The answer is that we have 144,000 people who
have committed serious crimes walking around with concealed weapons
permits. That's 2,880 per state.

There is no one to root for in ``Inside the NRA.'' There are no
top-drawer folks to be found. Steve Bannon becomes Powell's ``great
friend'' because they are both ``Washington warriors in the business of
fighting for the little guy.''

Powell makes for a dubious moralist. There's room for just one example.
When he talks about the Zegna suits and trips on private jets that
LaPierre expensed to the N.R.A., Powell writes: ``Times were tough, and
it was not the time for Wayne to treat the association like a personal
piggy bank.'' It would have been fine, in other words, at a better
moment.

There's a lot more in ``Inside the NRA.'' Powell defends the AR-15 ---
the N.R.A. prefers to call it a ``modern sporting rifle'' --- and
reports that his wife has to tell him to put his away when guests are
coming over. He suggests that, given the fanatical nature of gun lovers
in Florida, and the ease with which they are stirred up, there may be
violence along the state's I-4 corridor after the election.

Powell's book is a mea culpa. About the N.R.A.'s Kool-Aid, he writes,
``I sold it, stirred it, drank it every day.'' He lost his soul, he
writes, and became part of the swamp. He'd like, he claims, again
unconvincingly, to see the N.R.A. largely return to its roots as an
organization dedicated to gun safety.

The N.R.A., in this telling as in others, is an organization in free
fall. About New York's attorney general, Letitia James, who has taken
existential aim at the N.R.A., he writes, ``I'm not betting against
her.''
