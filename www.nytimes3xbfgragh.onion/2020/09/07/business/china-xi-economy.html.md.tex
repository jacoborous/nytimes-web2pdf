Inward}\label{xis-post-virus-economic-strategy-for-china-looks-inward}}

The Chinese leader's latest approach calls for a more robust domestic
economy to insulate growth from tensions with the United States.

He
\href{http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/leaders/2020-07/24/c_1126281973.htm}{inspected
fields of corn} amid jitters about food supplies. He visited steel works
trying to overcome a slump in profits. He toured an innovation center at
a time when
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/23/business/trump-technology-china-trade.html}{President
Trump has raised barriers} against China's technological takeoff.

China's leader, Xi Jinping, has used his recent trips to highlight a
warning: The country must retool its economy to be more self-sustaining
in a post-pandemic world of uncertainty, weakened demand and hostility.

China needs its people to spend more and its manufacturers to be more
innovative, Mr. Xi has said, to ease dependence on fickle foreign
economies. Most pressing,
\href{http://news.youth.cn/sz/202008/t20200804_12436479.htm}{official
media comments} on Mr. Xi's strategy have said, China must be ready for
sustained acrimony with the United States that could
\href{http://sky.cssn.cn/skyskl/skyskl_jczx/202008/t20200826_5174247.shtml}{put
at risk} its access to American consumers, investors and know-how.

``The world has entered a period of turbulence and transformation,'' Mr.
Xi
\href{http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/leaders/2020-08/24/c_1126407763.htm}{told
an audience of prominent Chinese economists} brought to the Communist
Party's headquarters in central Beijing late last month. ``We face an
external environment with even more headwinds and countercurrents.''

China must ``make breakthroughs in core technologies as quickly as
possible,'' Mr. Xi said.

Mr. Xi has called his new initiative a ``dual circulation'' strategy.
The grandly technocratic name, which he
\href{http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/leaders/2020-05/14/c_1125986000.htm}{first
used} in May, means China should rely on a robust cycle of domestic
demand and innovation as the main driver of the economy while
maintaining foreign markets and investors as a second engine of growth.

To some, Mr. Xi's latest initiative looks like a glossy reboot of
longstanding efforts to overhaul the Chinese economy. Chinese leaders
\href{https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-03/02/content_818091_4.htm}{have
promised} since at least 2006 to make domestic consumer spending a
bigger share of economic activity, reducing reliance on exports and
infrastructure building --- with mixed success.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/09/07/business/07china-economy-2/merlin_175581651_8f37a20e-ec4f-4668-9e82-63b91ae7bb40-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

But Mr. Xi's new strategy demands to be taken seriously, even if its
implications are still hazy. He has cast it as a security imperative to
keep China growing in an era of global turbulence, and that new
geopolitical urgency will raise pressure on officials to show results.

``This policy has a lot to do with China's changing international
environment, particularly the deterioration of Sino-American
relations,''
\href{https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/faculty/fulltime/y/239558.htm}{Yao
Yang}, the dean of the National School of Development at Peking
University, said in an emailed response to questions. ``China needs to
prepare for the worst-case scenario, in which the U.S. seals off China
in certain tech areas.''

Chinese officials and experts have already been rushing out rival
proposals to flesh out Mr. Xi's strategy. Some have urged the government
to \href{https://www.sohu.com/a/414506166_729263}{ramp up support} for
Chinese technology companies. Others have
\href{http://www.aisixiang.com/data/122269.html}{called for reducing
barriers}to foreign investors, to help ensure that China keeps its
friends and is not cut off.

China's formula for growth has been evolving, though in the view of some
economists, too slowly. Exports contribute notably less to economic
growth than they did a decade ago, but the
\href{https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2018/11/12/Chinas-Rebalancing-Recent-Progress-Prospects-and-Policies-46291}{shift
to domestic consumption has been incremental}. And China depends on
imports of technology, crops and energy, adding to the government's
worries about external vulnerability.

``Frankly, a succession of policies from the Trump administration have
made us see the importance of this more clearly,'' Yu Yongding, an
economist in Beijing who previously advised China's central bank, said
in a telephone interview, referring to Mr. Xi's new emphasis on domestic
consumption. ``We may step up the pace of our adjustment.''

Mr. Xi has said that dual circulation will shape China's
\href{http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-08/27/c_139320265.htm}{next
five-year development plan}, which will be largely finalized later this
year and rolled out next year. A Communist Party leaders' meeting
\href{http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-07/31/c_139252599.htm}{in
October} is likely to reveal more of what Mr. Xi has in mind for that
plan and beyond.

The leaders will be sorting through competing proposals on how to meet
Mr. Xi's goals as they hammer together the five-year plan. Central to
their deliberations is how China should handle restrictions by the
United States and other advanced economies that have become increasingly
frustrated by and wary of China.

In the end, Mr. Xi's preference for state dominance is likely to
determine what proposals become policy.

``I do think that China is preparing for an even further degree of
decoupling,''
\href{http://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/zhu-ning}{Zhu Ning}, a
deputy dean at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, said in an
interview. ``In most of the propaganda, the domestic consumption cycle
receives far more attention than the foreign cycle.''

Mr. Xi's recent itinerary reflects the broader strategy he is mapping
for China while the United States and other Western powers remain
largely consumed with the coronavirus crisis.

Inspecting the flat, fertile farmland of northeast China in late July,
he \href{http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/31797420}{spoke of} ensuring
that the country could feed itself. In Anhui Province in central China,
he visited \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzwkIJt3jTE\&t=1048s}{a
tech innovation center} with displays of ``quantum security'' mobile
phones, microchips and other symbols of homegrown technological prowess.

China faces an ``external environment where the global market is
shrinking,'' Mr. Xi said while visiting Anhui,
\href{http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2020/0824/c1001-31833325.html}{according
to the People's Daily}, the party's main newspaper. China's exports
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/business/chinas-exports-rise-despite-the-virus-surprising-economists.html}{have
rebounded} from the shock of the first months of the pandemic, but Mr.
Xi suggested that the longer-term outlook was uncertain.

China's stepped up effort to remake its economy was a ``long-term
strategic move,'' he said, as if to pre-empt any doubt about his
resolve.

Mr. Xi's program is likely to bring more measures to support domestic
service industries, such as tourism, and more support for new energy
sources to displace imports,
\href{http://en.rdcy.org/indexen/index/leader_cont/pid/692/id/14791.html}{Wang
Wen}, executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, a
think tank in Beijing, said in an interview. He said that the new
strategy implied a more ambitious agenda than just expanding consumer
spending.

To increase domestic consumption, the Chinese government would have to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/world/europe/thomas-piketty-china.html}{markedly
reduce inequality} by shifting wealth to ordinary households. Poorer
people are unlikely to spend freely when they lack disposable income and
tend to save money for emergencies.

That could require difficult social and economic changes that have met
official resistance. Mr. Xi's new edict has also revived decades-long
calls for
\href{https://finance.sina.com.cn/review/hgds/2020-08-19/doc-iivhuipn9395668.shtml}{breaking
down bureaucratic barriers} that make it difficult for rural residents
working in cities to get medical care or send their children to schools.

``Any efforts to reduce inequality would, in theory at least, translate
into higher domestic consumption,''
\href{https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/golley-je}{Jane
Golley}, an economist at the Australian National University in Canberra,
said by telephone. ``The failings that they've had there is part of the
reason that they've struggled to see a significant boost in the share of
consumption.''

Mr. Xi's dual circulation initiative may have a more immediate impact by
redoubling efforts to build homegrown technology and reduce China's need
for foreign-made microchips and other key components in smartphones,
computers and other equipment.

Many Chinese officials and analysts say that American enmity has
compelled Beijing to spend more on creating its own crucial
technologies. In the latest blow, the Trump administration
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/technology/trump-huawei-commerce-chips.html}{announced}
in August that it was restricting the ability of Huawei, the Chinese
telecommunications equipment giant, to buy chips made or designed with
American equipment and software.

The new strategy does not mean that Beijing is closing the door on
foreign investors and markets,
\href{http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/leaders/2020-08/24/c_1126407763.htm}{Chinese
officials assert}, and experts say that a rupture with the United States
would be economically devastating for both sides.

A debate has emerged about how China should balance strengthening its
economic fortifications while keeping access to foreign markets.

Professor Yu, the economist in Beijing, set off controversy by
\href{https://new.qq.com/omn/20200819/20200819A0CBG700.html}{arguing
last month that Mr. Xi's new initiative} should include revamping ``Made
in China 2025,'' a program to support domestic manufacturing that other
governments criticized as unfair. In the interview, Mr. Yu said that he
was not arguing for state-driven industrial planning, and wanted
commercial investment to drive the effort.

A push for technological independence could further alarm those in the
West who have worried that China has turned its back on Deng Xiaoping's
era of ``reform and opening up.''

``Those hawks would say: `See, we were right about China's state
capitalism,''' Professor Yao of Peking University said, adding that he
believed that China and the United States could resolve disputes over
technological rivalry through negotiation.

Mr. Xi often orchestrates policy drives by first issuing sweeping
commands, leaving subordinates to hammer out detailed proposals. In
2015, he launched
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/03/04/world/asia/xi-jinping-china-economic-policy.html}{supply-side
structural reform}'' to cut bloated industrial capacity, and it evolved
from a catchphrase to a campaign that
\href{https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2018/dec/chinas-supply-side-structural-reform.html}{bore
results}.

``The leadership doesn't issue slogans like these because they think
things will be easy. They issue them to force focus, mobilization and
prioritization,''
\href{https://www.cfr.org/expert/julian-gewirtz}{Julian Gewirtz}, a
senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who studies Chinese
politics, said by email. ``Dual circulation has a lot of mileage left to
go before it's towed off to the junkyard of discarded slogans.''
