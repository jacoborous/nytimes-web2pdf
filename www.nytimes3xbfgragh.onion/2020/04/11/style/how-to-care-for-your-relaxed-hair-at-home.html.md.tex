Relaxing your own roots is notoriously difficult to get right and can be
damaging to the hair. But you do have options.

Much of the conversation surrounding black hair in recent years has been
about caring for and styling natural hair, and for good reason. As news
spread that relaxers may cause hormone disruptions and other health
issues, black women, in droves, began to cut off their relaxed hair and
wear their natural texture.

Yet many black women still do chemically straighten their hair. And
right now, they're locked out of their main source of maintenance: the
salon.

As relaxed hair grows out, the new roots can create styling challenges,
like edges that won't lie smooth. Then, over time, breakage can occur at
the fragile line between the old straight hair and the new textured
roots.

``The longer you wait to relax the new growth, the more you run the risk
of breakage,'' said Ursula Stephen, a hairstylist who owns a salon in
Brooklyn. Combing and styling creates more friction in curly roots than
in straight ends. And the added tension can easily snap hair at the
demarcation line, in strands already weakened by chemical processing.

Decades ago, it was commonplace to relax one's hair at home, but as
women began to rely on in-salon maintenance, fewer have experience in
D.I.Y.-ing.

``At first, people were willing to wait this out,'' said Jihan Thompson,
the chief executive of \href{https://www.swivelbeauty.com/}{Swivel
Beauty}, a booking app that vets salons that specialize in black and
textured hair. Now, as people realize they'll be away from their
stylists for the foreseeable future, they're looking for solutions.

Ms. Thompson hopes Swivel can help fill the hair-care gap with virtual
hairstyling consultations, in which stylists walk clients through
services like blowouts, protective styles and relaxer touch-ups.

``A lot of people are going to work virtually via video calls so they
don't have to just pull their hair in a bun,'' she said. ``This is a way
stylists can continue to support them.''

Here, we explore some at-home options with three hair-care experts.

\hypertarget{dont-relax-but-do-moisturize}{%
\subsection{Don't Relax, but Do
Moisturize}\label{dont-relax-but-do-moisturize}}

Instead of relaxing, you could just let your roots grow and treat them
with a lot of moisture, Ms. Stephen said. Moisture keeps the hair more
supple and helps prevent breakage. Deep condition more frequently. If
you were on a twice-a-month schedule, step it up to weekly.

``Apply leave-in conditioner daily and focus on that line of
demarcation,'' Ms. Stephen said. As you moisturize more, manipulate your
hair less.

``The more combing you do, the more breakage you'll have,'' she said.
``This a good time to focus on caring for your hair and doing protective
styling.''

You can over-moisturize, she said, but it's not a big deal. ``The
biggest risk is it gets too soft, but all you have to do then is stop
adding so much moisture,'' she said. ``It's reversible, but breakage
isn't.''

\subsection{Don't Relax, but Do Use a Flat
Iron}\label{dont-relax-but-do-use-a-flat-iron}}

For medium to long hair, straightening your roots with a flat iron is a
good styling alternative to relaxing, said Tinika Sadiku of Hair by
Sadiku in Manhattan. Her advice: Work with small, thin sections of hair
and do so slowly.

\subsection{Relax Your Roots at Home}\label{relax-your-roots-at-home}}

If you've watched your hairstylist touch up your roots for years, you
may have a false sense of confidence in your ability to mimic the
process at home. The most difficult aspect of relaxing your own hair is
not being able to see the back and crown, said Joie Wallace, a
hairstylist and colorist in Virginia.

When touching up your roots, it's important to avoid putting relaxer on
hair that's already straight. This is why people who do their own
relaxers often have breakage at the back and crown --- they can't see
what they're doing. If you can, ask a helper to apply relaxer in those
areas. Or, set up your work station between two mirrors so you have more
visibility.

Hairstylists emphasize that you do not have to relax all of your roots.
For very short hair, a so-called edge-up relaxes just the back of the
hair, temples and sides. (Picture the hair that remains in male pattern
baldness.)

``I don't think there's a stylist alive who would say you should be
aiming to get your hair perfectly straight,'' Ms. Sadiku said. ``This is
about trying to feel a little more normal --- not perfection.''

Opt for no-lye relaxer. It's a gentler option that's better for a
nonprofessional use. Ms. Wallace recommends the
\href{https://www.amazon.com/conditioning-relaxer-childrens-regular-application/dp/B005IUGXY4}{Just
for Me No-Lye Conditioning
Cr}\textbf{\href{https://www.amazon.com/conditioning-relaxer-childrens-regular-application/dp/B005IUGXY4}{è}}\href{https://www.amazon.com/conditioning-relaxer-childrens-regular-application/dp/B005IUGXY4}{me
Relaxer Kit,} \$21.39. Follow the instructions that come with the kit.
These tips will help you optimize the process.

Here's the most important rule: Coat only your new growth with relaxer.
Applying relaxer to already straightened hair will cause breakage.

Tool kit: No-lye relaxer kit, moisturizing conditioner, gloves, tail
comb, towel.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Apply the basing treatment (something like petroleum jelly that's
  typically included in the kit) around your hairline and ears to
  protect your skin. And wrap your shoulders with a towel.
\item
  Part your hair into four sections. Slather conditioner, like
  \href{https://www.sheamoisture.com/jamaican-black-castor-oil-strengthen-and-restore-treatment-masque/764302215554.html}{Shea
  Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen \& Restore Treatment
  Masque,} \$13.99, on your straightened hair to create a barrier. Then
  clip away the sections you're not working on.
\item
  Part two-inch wide sections of hair and apply the relaxer to the roots
  with the back of the comb. Work your way through each section using
  this technique.
\item
  Let it process for the proper amount of time according to your
  instructions (usually 10 minutes). It's important to move quickly
  while applying relaxer so you don't overprocess your hair.
\item
  Shampoo the relaxer out with the neutralizing shampoo included in your
  kit.

  Your stylist can whip the relaxer through all of your roots at once.
  But if that feels difficult for you, Ms. Stephens suggests going
  through the process --- from application to shampoo --- on just the
  front two sections of your hair, first. Relaxer should be applied only
  to dry hair, though. So make sure the back sections aren't damp when
  you start the process over again there.
