Bond}\label{tenet-review-christopher-nolans-time-bending-take-on-james-bond}}

John David Washington stars as an unnamed, uncreased C.I.A. agent in a
spectacle full of scenes running backward and forward.

LONDON --- Maybe it is our collective enslavement to the
superhero-industrial complex, but right now the movie world is looking
for a savior. If it turns out to be
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/12/movies/dunkirk-christopher-nolan-interview.html}{Christopher
Nolan}, it wouldn't be the first time: Films of his, like ``Inception,''
``Interstellar'' and ``Dunkirk,'' have, in years past, ``saved''
summers, reputations, studios. His ``Dark Knight'' trilogy sure saved
the Warner Bros.-DC partnership --- in fact possibly he saved that a bit
too hard, with franchise filmmakers ever since toiling in his shadow.
Can Nolan save cinema from the coronavirus, its deadliest foe yet?
Perhaps, if Covid-19 can be tripped up by the grandfather paradox or has
a hitherto undiscovered weakness for sharp tailoring.

The hotly anticipated ``\href{https://www.tenetfilm.com/}{Tenet},''
opening Aug. 26 in some international territories and Sept. 3 in the
United States, is reassuringly massive in every way --- except
thematically. Ideally presented in 70-millimeter Imax, Nolan's
preferred, towering aspect ratio, arrayed with the telegenic faces of a
cast of incipient superstars, gorgeously shot across multiple global
locations and pivoting on an elastic, time-bending conceit (more on that
later/earlier), the film is undeniably enjoyable, but its giddy
grandiosity only serves to highlight the brittleness of its purported
braininess. This would hardly be a criticism of any other blockbuster.
But Nolan is, by several exploding football fields, the foremost auteur
of the ``intellectacle,'' which combines popcorn-dropping visual
ingenuity with all the sedate satisfactions of a medium-grade Sudoku.
Within the context of this self-created brand of brainiac entertainment,
``Tenet'' meets all expectations, except the expectation that it will
exceed them. Forgive the circularity of this argument: it's a side
effect of watching the defiantly circular ``Tenet.''

With unforeseen irony, the film, which will be largely be shown in
limited-capacity theaters, begins in a packed auditorium. It is an opera
house in Kyiv and it is being held up. One of the attackers, superbly
played by John David Washington, reveals himself to be a C.I.A. agent
who has infiltrated the operation to rescue an asset, when a curious
thing happens. A bullet, fired by an unknown ally, reverses out of a
nearby seat, the wood around the bullet hole desplintering. Scarcely has
the agent time to wonder, palindromically, ``Huh?'' when he is
distracted by having to save hundreds of civilians from certain death.

We are a scant few minutes into the film's 2½-hour run time and it has
already delivered: the sequence ends with interior and exterior shots of
an explosion, which the editor Jennifer Lame transforms with as perfect
an action cut as ever there was. In that microsecond, we're reminded of
something the last few months have conspired to make us forget:
cinematic scale. ``Tenet'' operates on a physiological level, in the
stomach-pit rumbles of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/11/arts/music/ludwig-goransson-mandalorian.html}{Ludwig
Goransson}'s score, and the dilated-pupil responses to Hoyte van
Hoytema's cinematography, which delivers the same magnificence whether
observing a narratively superfluous catamaran race, or the nap and weave
of Jeffrey Kurland's immaculately creaseless costumes. Seriously, the
most mind-boggling aspect of ``Tenet'' might be the ironing budget.

Washington's unnamed character is quickly inducted into the mysteries of
``inversion,'' a process by which an object --- or a person --- can have
its entropy reversed, making it appear, to those of us moving lamely
forward through time, as if it is spooling backward. His new
inversion-related mission leads him first to a fixer, Neil (a delightful
Robert Pattinson), useful for both his action chops and his master's in
physics, then to a Mumbai arms dealer (Dimple Kapadia), whose fortress
apartment can only be accessed by bungee jump, and thence to the
villainous Ukrainian squillionaire Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), who
can only be accessed via his wife, Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), a miserable,
imperiled art dealer who loathes him.

For once, spoiler sensitivity might be the reviewer's luckiest break,
absolving me of even attempting an explanation of a plot so contorted
it's best not to worry about it. Even the scientist played by Clémence
Poésy, here exclusively to deliver exposition, eventually cops out.
``Don't try to understand it, feel it'' is the best advice anyone
offers. Suffice to say, the time-inversion idea is most impressive not
in the film's grander architecture, which, as widely surmised, loosely
resembles a palindrome, but in single scenes in which some elements run
forward while others reverse. Similar to ``Inception,'' which created an
entire dream-world mythology only to have its
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6XkEEzjVFA}{revolving-hallway
tussle} become its most iconic sequence, in ``Tenet,'' time inversion
poses a civilization-annihilating threat, but the killer scene is,
again, a corridor fight. We see it twice, and each time, after your
brain clicks to one of the combatants fighting forward in time while the
other goes backward, the sheer how-did-they-do-that ingenuity is
dazzling.

``Tenet'' dazzles the senses, but it does not move the heart --- a
criticism common to all of Nolan's original films. And other widely
recognized Nolan blind spots are also in evidence: it's depressing that
as fine an actress as Debicki should be saddled with such a cipher role,
given a son in lieu of a character and made responsible for the story's
only bad decisions. Everyone else performs to perfection, especially
Washington's history-less protagonist who proves that not all
superheroes wear capes. Some wear the hell out of suits so dapper that
one of the film's biggest laughs comes when Nolan talisman Michael Caine
glances at Washington, looking better, in his dark-blue ensemble, than
possibly any human man has ever looked, and sneers Britishly, ``Brooks
Brothers is not going to cut it.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/21/arts/21tenet-2/21tenet-2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Washington is basically James Bond, forward and backward, a kind of
00700, right down to the occasional wry one-liner. And if it takes
megastar charisma to be able to memorably inhabit so vaporous a role, he
is also blessed to be playing off an equally unflappable Pattinson ---
their chemistry, rather than the sexless semi-flirtation between
Washington's hero and Debicki's damsel, gives the film whatever romance
it has.

But it's not just lack of heart that holds ``Tenet'' back. Nolan
imagines impossible technologies but won't explore their deeper
implications. This is frustrating because in Branagh's Sator --- the
film's most multifaceted character even if all the facets are malevolent
--- Nolan gets so close. Sator's motivation in bringing the future to
war with the past has chilling ramifications, and maybe it's the
nihilism of these pandemic-era, post-Thanos-snap times, but it sets up
an unsatisfied desire to watch the worst-case scenario unfold. Instead,
at the moment of maximum potential chaos, Nolan retreats to the relative
safety of spy movie convention.

Indeed, take away the time-bending gimmick, and ``Tenet" is a series of
timidly generic set pieces: heists, car chases, bomb disposals, more
heists. But then, the lie of Nolan's career has been that he makes the
traditionally teenage-boy-aimed blockbuster smarter and more adult, when
what he really does is ennoble the teenage boy fixations many of us
adults still cherish, creating vast, sizzling conceptual landscapes in
which all anyone really does is crack safes and blow stuff up.

But gosh, does he blow stuff up good. And that's not nothing, right now,
when it is probably scale and explosions and complex stunts, rather than
Deep Meaning, that will be what gets corona-shy moviegoers to brave the
multiplex. Perhaps ``Tenet'' can even provide a nostalgic glimpse of who
we were, just months ago on the other side of our own weird experiment
in time. At one point, Sator's yacht is moored off the Amalfi Coast near
Pompeii --- a city petrified at the height of its decadence by a
volcanic explosion it could not see coming. So seems ``Tenet,'' the kind
of hugely expensive, blissfully empty spectacle it is difficult to
imagine getting made in the near-to-medium future, now a fascinating
artifact of a lovably clueless civilization unaware of the disaster
lurking around the corner.

Seek it out, if only to marvel at the entertainingly inane glory of what
we once had and are in danger of never having again. Well, that and the
suits.

\textbf{Tenet}\\
Rated PG-13 for forward and reversed violence, mild headaches, desirable
men's wear. Running time: 2 hours 30 minutes. Opening Aug. 26 in select
theaters around the world. Opening Sept. 3 in the United States.
