## What Biden Must Do

### With Jamelle Bouie, Frank Bruni, Michelle Cottle and Michelle Goldberg

#### A special round-table episode on what’s at stake during this week’s Democratic convention. Plus: a requiem for the “nerd Coachella.”

Thursday, August 20th, 2020

</div>

  - michelle goldberg  
    I’m Michelle Goldberg.

  - michelle cottle  
    I’m Michelle Cottle.

  - jamelle bouie  
    I’m Jamelle Bouie.

  - frank bruni  
    And I’m Frank Bruni, and this is “The Argument.”
    
    The Democratic convention is finally here, if you can even call it a
    convention. Like all else about a presidential campaign conducted in
    the shadow of a pandemic, it’s nothing like what happened in years
    past. Does that negate its usefulness? What can and should Democrats
    accomplish through this socially-distanced virtual extravaganza?
    
    To answer these questions, we’re doing something a little different
    today. Four of us are hosting the show, but none of the four is
    Ross, who’s on vacation. And we’re gathering on Tuesday morning
    after the first night of the convention. So we’re in the middle of a
    news event, which means plenty is going to happen after this
    recording. But whatever transpires, there are questions that will
    endure between now and election day and the morning after. They’re
    questions about the Biden-Harris ticket, about the state of the
    Democratic party, and about the threats to the election. So with no
    further throat-clearing, let me welcome our guest co-hosts — Jamelle
    Bouie, a columnist on the opinion desk, and Michelle Cottle, a
    member of our editorial board. Welcome to you both.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Yeah, welcome, you guys.

  - jamelle bouie  
    Hello.

  - michelle cottle  
    Excellent to be here.

  - frank bruni  
    So let’s get right into it, starting with Kamala Harris. She seems
    to have excited people about November, and excitement was something
    that the Biden campaign was sorely lacking up to this point. I want
    to know what you all made of this pick, what its pros and cons are.
    And so I’m going to start with you, Jamelle. Were you happy with
    this pick, in a strategic sense?

  - jamelle bouie  
    Sure. I can’t say that I was happy or unhappy about the pick. My
    range of emotions, with regards to politics, don’t really go in that
    spectrum. \[GOLDBERG LAUGHS\] But as far as thinking through the
    meaning of the pick, I think, as a political pick, it makes a lot of
    sense. And I think among the broader Democratic electorate, Harris
    is a pretty popular figure, a pretty well-liked figure. It may
    marginally increase the number in turnout for African-Americans and
    other groups. I think the weakness of the pick may come if Biden
    wins and takes office and it’s time to govern. Because I think one
    of Harris’s weaknesses during the primary was it wasn’t really quite
    sure what her vision was for governing the country. And given that a
    Biden administration will have to start immediately — no time for
    trying to figure things out, this is a running start — I think it
    matters that Harris, as a political figure, doesn’t seem to have
    some sort overarching vision for government, especially given the
    unusually high likelihood that she’ll end up taking over for Biden
    at some point, given his age.

  - michelle cottle  
    So for me, I was pleased by the pick. But more than that, I was
    relieved. What I wanted was for whoever was chosen to not be
    surprising, at least for people who watch politics even remotely
    closely. I didn’t want it to be a story that derailed everything.
    You don’t want this campaign, as it’s going right now, to get
    dramatically shifted because someone super out of the blue gets put
    on the ticket. And this sounds weird to say because, obviously, she
    is the first African-American woman who is in this position, but she
    was a completely unsurprising pick, almost the safe pick. She’s run
    for high office and been publicly vetted at a level that a lot of
    the people who were considered front-runners were not. It also was a
    nice signal that he’s not going to hold a grudge. Considering how
    petty the sitting president is, for Biden to have overlooked the
    early squabbling between him and Kamala, it just sent a nice signal.
    And then, of course, she is exciting, on some level. This is going
    beyond the usual ticket of two boring old white guys. It’s not
    exactly what the progressive left would have hoped for, but I think
    it does what it needs to do.

  - frank bruni  
    Michelle Goldberg, I want to kind of pivot off of Michelle Cottle’s
    mention of the progressive left. Before this choice, there was a lot
    of talk about progressives having issues with Kamala. And it seems
    to me, but tell me if I’m not seeing it correctly, that since the
    choice, there’s been real unity. People have fallen in line. Is that
    your take on it, or what do you make of the progressive reaction
    thus far to Kamala’s presence on the ticket?

  - michelle goldberg  
    Well, look, I think that there was always going to be sort of
    hardcore Bernie people who were very disappointed by Kamala,
    although people often forget. It’s kind of funny that we talk about
    Kamala as if she was some moderate when, by a lot of measures, she’s
    one of the most progressive senators. But she has kind of a
    troubling criminal justice record. She’s not as progressive as some
    of the other candidates on issues like Israel that matter a lot to a
    kind of incoming cohort of young progressives. She’s seen as closer
    to Wall Street certainly than Elizabeth Warren. My sense is that the
    Biden camp — I don’t know if they did this deliberately, but they
    were very, very smart, I think, to make it seem like it was going to
    be Susan Rice. Because that meant that when it was Kamala, almost
    everybody could feel a sense of relief, including people on the
    left. And I also think Bernie Sanders himself has played a really
    helpful role here, right? Bernie Sanders has endorsed this pick and
    so have other people who have credibility on the left. And then
    finally, I think that just seeing a lot of progressive black women
    who were really, really moved and overjoyed by this. And kind of
    seeing that made it a little bit harder for some other people, I
    think, on the left to quibble overly much because you just sort of
    had to recognize what this meant for a lot of people that are
    admired on the left. The funny thing about this pick is that before
    the entire primary started, if you would asked I think a lot of
    people, what is the most likely Democratic ticket? They would have
    said Biden-Harris. And so we just went through so much drama, the
    ups and downs of the presidential campaign, of the vice presidential
    search to end up pretty much exactly where it always seemed like we
    were going.

  - frank bruni  
    It’s like that line in Edward Albee’s “The Zoo Story,” sometimes you
    have to go a long way out of the way to come a short way back.
    \[GOLDBERG LAUGHS\] That’s the story of the Democratic primary. We
    could talk for a long time about Kamala and about this ticket. But
    because we’ve got so much ground to cover, you just mentioned Bernie
    Sanders. He was there on the first night of the Democratic
    convention — or maybe one of you as a better noun. I’m not sure what
    we’re supposed to call this virtual event. But I’m really curious to
    hear what you all made of the event, given the difficulty of doing
    this without an arena, without a crowd that’s clapping and
    screaming, whether you thought the choreography of it worked, or
    whether you think this convention is going to end up mattering less
    than conventions ever have because of the coronavirus-mandated
    adaptations.

  - michelle cottle  
    Well, I had talked to the convention planners about this, and they
    had been thinking of ways to make it less — not staged, I guess, but
    even before they kind of knew what they were going to be dealing
    with the virus, they wanted to get more regular people in there. And
    I thought that the clips from people talking about their dreams and
    fears and hardships was actually kind of a good addition. These
    conventions tend to be about a lot of schmoozing and stuff behind
    the scenes. And then the public face of them is a long series of
    really boring, for the most part, speeches. And it’s like a big
    advertisement for the party. I do think that particularly in this
    moment, it helps to have a little bit of a reminder of what real
    people are going through. And because they couldn’t have everybody
    in Milwaukee and they were going to have to do it virtually anyway,
    you might as well take advantage of different people, different
    places.

  - frank bruni  
    Jamelle, you wrote in the great scorecard that “The Times” does with
    various people, grading what’s happening at the convention, you
    thought Bernie Sanders was a real highlight and his speech was
    particularly important. Why is that so, not just in terms of the
    first night of the convention, but in terms of now going through
    Nov. 3?

  - jamelle bouie  
    So I’ve been listening to Bernie Sanders speeches in one form or
    another for five years, and they typically have kind of the same
    rhythm to them and they hit the same themes. And I thought this one
    was interesting and notable in that it wasn’t really a typical
    Bernie Sanders speech at all, and it was very much the sort of plea
    for coalition-building, right? That one at the very beginning that
    he’ll work with anyone, even conservative Republicans, to stop Trump
    I thought was very important. Given that the political theme of the
    convention is essentially that Biden is leading a silent majority of
    anti-Trump Americans across kind of a demographic and political
    spectrum, having Sanders as the most prominent left-wing voice in
    American politics say that was really important. I thought it hit
    the exact right note of impressing upon listeners just the stakes of
    the election and the stakes of letting Trump win again. I thought
    Michelle Obama’s speech, on a similar point, did the same thing.

  - frank bruni  
    Michelle Obama was, as expected, extraordinary. I was really struck,
    in terms of Sanders, his tone, which you’re right to focus on, felt
    so different to me from 2016. I mean, he said vote for Hillary back
    then. The words were correct. The script was what it was supposed to
    be. But I sensed this time around from Bernie Sanders, and really
    kind of from the whole party, a whole new appreciation of the
    stakes. And Michelle Goldberg, it gave me some real hope that
    between now and Nov. 3 and on Nov. 3, we may see no repeat of what
    happened in 2016. Am I just being a ridiculous optimist, or do you
    have that same hope?

  - michelle goldberg  
    No, I mean, I think that I have that same hope. I think there might
    be a fair number of people who didn’t vote in 2016 not even out of
    some sort of deep ideological aversion to Hillary Clinton, but just
    out of a sense that they didn’t care that much for her and they
    thought it was in the bag, right? They didn’t foresee this utter
    catastrophe, this utter destruction of most of our day-to-day lives.
    And so yes, I think it’s very hard for anyone to pull the kind of
    tweedle-dum, tweedle-dee thing that certain people on the left have
    been pulling for most of my adult life. That said, one of the
    interesting things about doing a convention this way is that it
    gives a lot less power to grassroots activists, for better or worse.
    The kind of people who disrupted the convention in 2016 because they
    were angry about the treatment of Bernie Sanders, because they were
    angry about some of the revelations in the emails that were hacked
    by the Russians at Trump’s behest, they just didn’t have a say in
    this, right? So there was this kind of interesting duality to it. On
    the one hand, you do hear in this convention from a lot more, quote
    unquote, “ordinary people,” people outside of politics. On the other
    hand, ordinary activists have basically no say in how things proceed
    because they can’t start cheers or chants or interrupting. And so it
    feels more sort of homespun but is actually a much more kind of
    produced and polished affair.

  - frank bruni  
    In terms of Democratic messaging and that which they can control,
    what do you think they need to accomplish in this convention and
    going forward to maximize the chances of the most votes on November
    3?

  - jamelle bouie  
    I think maybe the important thing that needs to happen, with regards
    to the entire convention, is the less about what is said and more
    about how what is said is reported. Because what we’ve sort of
    learned over the past four years is that earned media, how coverage
    goes out to the public is actually really important to shaping voter
    perceptions. You could make a good case that Biden is the nominee
    because the one-two punch of South Carolina and all those
    endorsements created this wave of positive earned media that drove
    the Democratic primary electorate to his side. And so to the extent
    that this convention presents a Democratic party that is unified,
    that is big tent, plenty of room for lots of different people of
    many different beliefs. To the extent that it shows a Democratic
    party that has a strongly contrasting message with the president,
    then I think it does its job. And I think it leaves the kind of
    impression you want voters to have. But beyond that, the specific
    things said, I don’t know. The general impression, that’s important.

  - frank bruni  
    I think that’s a great point about earned media, by which, for the
    listeners who aren’t up on the jargon, we mean the reporting that
    happens independent of a political campaign’s chosen ads and stuff
    like that. But you’re seeing, apart from the programming at the
    convention, a lot of stories right now about how many Republicans
    have turned their backs on Trump and are actually campaigning for
    Biden. And that’s the great example of what the party is programming
    and talking about ends up going out into a thousand other media
    channels and reaching the public in different ways.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Also most people are not going to be watching this in a multi-hour
    block. So a lot of what matters is the little clips that get
    repurposed and shown on the news and shown on talk shows.
    Journalists are going to watch the convention in totality, and
    what’s going to matter for how it resonates is these kind of
    little moments that become almost memes or become, as you said,
    earned media. I miss real conventions. I see a lot of people, kind
    of cynical journalists, saying, like, oh yeah, conventions suck, and
    so much nicer to watch them from your couch. I actually love
    political conventions — maybe not Republican ones, certainly not
    anymore. People used to call the White House Correspondents Dinner
    “nerd prom.” The Democratic convention is like “nerd Coachella.”
    You see people that you haven’t seen in forever. There’s all these
    tertiary events. Except for the big headline speeches, there’s five
    different places you could be at any one time. And so you experience
    it in this much more fragmentary way. I think that it’s not ideal to
    have a convention like this, from the party’s perspective. But the
    party does have much, much more control in this format of what to
    highlight. Often, these speeches would happen, and the live coverage
    would break away because you’re button-holing people in the hallway
    to interview different people in the party. They have much more
    control over the message in this format, and that could end up being
    good for them.

  - frank bruni  
    Michelle Cottle, the climax, the headline act of this virtual nerd
    Coachella is Joe Biden’s speech on Thursday night. You have written
    extensively and wonderfully about the various influences on Joe
    Biden, about his sort of path through the primary to this point.
    What are you expecting, and what are you wanting from it? What can
    he accomplish with this speech that he maybe hasn’t accomplished yet
    but needs to?

  - michelle cottle  
    I don’t think he needs to do a lot of complicated things. I think,
    as with the message of the convention in general, he needs to convey
    the basics of compassion and competence. Now, he has a leg up, at
    this point, because the Trump campaign has basically painted him as
    a drooling imbecile sitting in his basement unable to string a
    sentence together. So all he needs to do, on some level, is clear
    that hurdle. He just needs to not pass out during his speech. But he
    needs to convey what I think people look to him for during the
    primary, which is a sense of humanity, a sense of empathy. That is
    something that, obviously, has been sorely lacking with the current
    administration. And the message of all these real people that
    they’re spotlighting at the convention talking about what they’ve
    been through is to kind of send the signal that this is the
    candidate who cares about this and who will actually take steps to
    improve your lives, that he cares about something other than his own
    ambitions and his own power. So I think just of conveying that, I
    feel your pain, I’m going to fix this. And then, of course, being
    not scary, and this is where the reaching out to Republicans, to
    progressives, the big-tent message will come into this. He has
    stressed that he wants to work with everyone. There is a place for
    everyone in his party. So I think all of those kind of basic things
    need to come through in the speech. He does not have to be Barack
    Obama. He is not a rhetorical god at this point, and he doesn’t even
    need to try that. So he just needs to let Joe be Joe, on some level.

  - frank bruni  
    Michelle Goldberg, you made the great point that this convention
    gives Democrats more control than ever before because it’s not
    happening at an arena, people aren’t standing up able to do whatever
    they want to do. Is it going to matter in the end? And in terms of
    it having to have been reinvented and abbreviated and crunched, do
    you think this might be the beginning of conventions mattering less?

  - michelle goldberg  
    I mean, I think it’s really hard to say, right? So it’s interesting
    to me to hear Jamelle be so sort of Spock-like in his response to
    this. And I’m curious about whether, Jamelle, have you always been
    like this, or was it the trauma of 2016? Because we were together at
    the conventions four years ago, and I feel like I had a lot of
    feelings. Maybe I was just projecting them onto you. But I remember
    being at the Democratic convention, and I wrote about this at the
    time, it was impeccable. Joe Biden gave one of the best speeches
    I’ve ever heard him give at that convention. Michelle Obama gave
    an amazing speech. Compared to the total shit show of Trump’s
    convention, which was this kind of pathetic shambolic thing with
    Scott Baio talking and a bunch of Nazis outside, I don’t think even
    the best-produced convention can change the political dynamics in
    the country. I do think a couple of things. I think first of all,
    conventions, beyond what they do for a candidate a couple months
    before the election, it’s good for a party to come together. It’s
    good for people to build these relationships. That’s why you have
    conventions not just of political parties, but of all sorts of
    organizations. It fosters cohesion. And so for that reason, I really
    hope that they resume them once they can. I also think that, again,
    because Donald Trump has chosen this particular attack on Joe Biden
    — that he’s senile, that he can’t talk, that he has to be hidden
    away from view — if he just gives a kind of mildly competent speech,
    a sort of ordinary, boilerplate political acceptance speech, it will
    do something to puncture that narrative. It seems — knock on wood —
    that it was potentially, from Trump’s point of view, a bad idea to
    lower expectations about your opponent to such levels.

  - frank bruni  
    I was just going to echo the points that both Michelle Goldberg and
    Michelle Cottle made that it’s really strange, just from a political
    strategy standpoint, to attack your opponent as a bumbling idiot and
    someone incapable of stringing together a sentence ahead of a major
    event where people will see that candidate string together a
    sentence, a series of sentences, and appear competent. If there’s
    any political advantage in this moment that the Democratic ticket
    has is that the Republican attacks — the Trump attacks, specifically
    — are just so removed from reality that once people get any kind of
    direct contact with that ticket, they’re going to be like, oh, well
    obviously the Trump campaign is full of crap, right? So Biden is a
    drooling imbecile, not going to be the case. Kamala Harris is an
    anti-police radical, people are going to see her speak and be like,
    that’s nonsense. It’s not going to be the case. The ticket as a
    whole is in the thrall of leftists, well, we just saw John Kasich
    give a four minute speech, so that’s probably not true. And I think
    the Trump campaign, because it cannot actually campaign on its
    record or on current conditions, is throwing everything at the wall
    and will find that that just doesn’t work, that a voting public
    actually wants to hear about what each ticket has to say about
    things happening now and that the Democratic ticket is mainstream to
    a fault, you could say. There’s nothing there that’s going to cause
    people to think, oh, these people are dangerous or radical.

  - michelle goldberg  
    But Jamelle, can I ask you a question? Both of us have seen Joe
    Biden speak a lot of times, and he’s pretty hit or miss. Like I
    said, in 2016, I thought he gave one of the best speeches at the
    convention. I’ve seen him give speeches on the campaign trail that
    left me with my heart in my throat, feeling like I was watching an
    actor forgetting his lines. This is such an important moment. Do you
    have any anxiety about how it’s going to come off?

  - jamelle bouie  
    He’s always done worse in his impromptu moments. But a prepared
    speech, he’s perfectly competent of giving. He’s been giving them
    for his entire adult life. So I’m not too worried about that. The
    things I’m worried about have really less to do with the Democratic
    ticket or with the Democratic coalition, although there are, of
    course, tensions and divides to talk about within that coalition.
    But the things I’m worried about have just much more to do with
    election administration and the entire process of the election and
    how that’s going to interact with the president’s, I think, clear
    efforts to delegitimize the outcome and also the Republican Party,
    how it relates to those attempts, right? Because for as much as the
    conversation has been about Trump’s attacks on the election, kind of
    the key actor on Nov. 3 and Nov. 4, depending on the outcome, will
    just be Republican-elected officials, how they react to what’s
    happened.

  - frank bruni  
    That’s a great point, Jamelle. Let’s use that as a pivot because
    this convention is four days in time. It will recede in the rearview
    mirror really quickly. But all around it — and Michelle Goldberg,
    you just wrote about this — we have this very clear evidence that
    Trump is cheating, is preparing to cheat yet more. We have this huge
    melodrama with the United States Postal Service. We have various
    other things the president has said and done to convince people that
    if the result of this election is not what they want, they can
    consider it illegitimate. How much does each of you, and let’s start
    with Michelle Cottle, worry about this truly being anything close to
    a free and fair election?

  - michelle cottle  
    Oh, I’m completely terrified on some level. Cheater’s gonna cheat.
    And I think that they’ve made clear they have no problem with doing
    whatever is necessary to undermine the process. I also worry about
    what happens if it is a remotely close election because all of
    President Trump’s efforts to delegitimize this become that much more
    of an issue if they are like, oh, well look, it was so close. They
    cheated. It’s all the systemic fraud from the mail-in voting. I
    think that the larger the margin is, the easier it will be for at
    least respectable Republican officials to say, OK, we need to move
    on, even if that infuriates certain segments of the base.

  - frank bruni  
    That’s what Michelle Obama was saying on Monday night at the
    convention. I thought one of the most fascinating parts of that
    extraordinary, excellent speech was when she was essentially saying,
    get your ballot tonight. Mail it in now, or prepare to go. Pack
    dinner and breakfast in case you have to wait on line. She was
    basically saying to America, you have got to deliver the
    Biden-Harris ticket such a margin that the cheating is erased and
    that there’s no ability for Donald Trump to say that this is a
    fraudulent result. I mean, that was such a kind of appropriately
    cynical instruction to the American public, don’t you think?

  - michelle goldberg  
    Well, and it’s not just the numbers that matter. It’s also the
    timing. Jamelle wrote about this that right now, there’s this
    asymmetry. And the Democrats are saying that they’re more likely to
    vote by mail because they are more likely to take coronavirus
    seriously and Republicans the opposite. And what that could end up
    meaning is if you look back to 2018, in the midterms, and on
    election night, it looked like Democrats had had a really
    disappointing night. And it took the days and weeks afterwards, as
    the full vote was counted, to realize that there really was a blue
    wave. If something like that happens with Trump, he’s extremely
    likely to just declare victory on election night and to try to shut
    down the vote count afterwards. And so if you think about, for those
    of us who are old enough to remember 2000, what happened with the
    fight over the recount in Florida and you multiply that by many
    states or many jurisdictions, and think back to the fact that Roger
    Stone, Trump’s criminal advisor, was involved in basically staging
    what is now known as the Brooks Brothers riot where a bunch of rowdy
    Republican operatives physically interfered with the vote count in a
    way that very likely changed the course of that election, while
    hapless Democrats relied on the courts. I do think that Democrats
    are not going to do that this time. They’re not just going to assume
    that the rule of law will prevail and the courts will protect them.
    And as I wrote today, people are already sort of organizing for the
    mass protest that’s going to be necessary if there is some sort of
    shenanigans with the vote count or if Trump tries to interfere
    within in some way. In 2016, the night Trump was elected, when I was
    envisioning all sorts of disasters, could I have imagined that he
    would try to destroy the post office in order to stop people from
    casting their ballots? Probably not. And so I don’t think we should
    assume that that is the last important American institution that he
    will use his power to try and wreck if he thinks that his holding
    onto power depends on it.

  - frank bruni  
    Right, so there are things that are outside of the Democratic
    party’s control. What can and should it do between now and
    November 3 to try to prevent the worst happening, to try to make
    this election as free and fair as it can possibly be? Jamelle, do
    you have any thoughts on that?

  - jamelle bouie  
    Yeah, I mean, I think Michelle Goldberg got to much of what would be
    included in that. It is first, providing for voters detailed
    instructions on how to get a ballot, how to cast a ballot, how to do
    it in person. It’s organizing efforts for people who need to go in
    person, to bring them in person. I think it would probably include
    distributing masks and stuff to voters who want them to kind of help
    people get themselves prepared for standing in line. Similar to what
    the R.N.C. and the Trump campaign are doing, kind of a nationwide
    plan to contest vote counts, which they’ve sort of announced that
    this is part of their election plan. I think the Democratic party
    and its affiliated institutions and organizations need to be
    prepping basically a defense of ballot counting, sort of a
    nationwide effort to stop that tampering. I think there needs to be
    plans for protests and demonstrations. This is going to sound very
    hyperbolic, but I think that we have to think of the task of getting
    Trump out as less of a traditional democratic transition and more of
    something akin to pushing an authoritarian regime out. And that’s
    going to mean in addition to at the ballot box on Nov. 3, there
    being a Biden lead at the end of the night. Because I think Trump is
    going to contest regardless. Regardless of the outcome, Trump is
    going to say, this was rigged. This is fake, whatever. But the key
    thing is, is there space for the Republican legislature in
    Pennsylvania or Michigan or Wisconsin to certify election night
    results and send those in before all the votes are counted to force
    basically a contest between the full count that’s if a governor
    certifies and the partial count that the legislature does. And
    demonstrations, a large vote count on election night, all those
    sorts of things send an important signal to Republican legislators
    and officials that if they take this step, they will be taking a
    step that directly affects their ability to hold power in the
    future. That’s the message of a demonstration — not for Trump
    because Trump I don’t think gives a shit.

  - michelle cottle  
    Now, there’s also something that the media needs to do. They need to
    start setting expectations, just as Trump is very aggressively
    pushing the idea that election night has to be it. You have to call
    this race on election night. I think there needs to be a fair amount
    of pushback where people are told, this very well could go on past
    the one night that everybody thinks of as the deciding moment,
    especially if it’s not a huge margin. And people have talked about
    the blue shift, where Democratic votes have been coming in on the
    later side. So what starts out looking like a close call then widens
    to be a more comfortable Democratic margin. Trump’s going to go
    berserk over things like that, and people need to be prepared but
    that is not cheating. That is not rigging this vote, that election
    night is no longer a drop-dead kind of moment. Because he’s been
    pushing the idea that if it’s not called on that night, it’s fake.
    And that’s just something that everyone else has to say, no, that’s
    nonsense.

  - frank bruni  
    Can I push back on one thing? Everything you say is 100 percent
    true, but I want any one of you who can reassure me to reassure me.
    We can report that, Michelle. We at The Times, our colleagues at the
    Washington Post, people on the responsible cable networks can do
    everything you’re saying, and yet we live in an information
    ecosystem where we’re never going to reach some of the people who
    most need to hear exactly what you said. What do we do about that?

  - michelle cottle  
    You’re never going to get everybody. I mean, you don’t worry about
    something just because it’s not going to be 100 percent. But you’re
    also talking to Republican officials. You need to put the pressure
    on them. It needs to be one of these things where only the fraction
    of the base who is going to believe whatever, Trump shoot somebody
    on Fifth Avenue, they’re cool with that. Everybody else needs to
    know the reality of the situation. You can’t break into that weird
    alternative bubble with everything. But everybody else who’s not
    drinking the Kool-Aid needs to understand this. The more people you
    can get to understand it, the more pressure gets brought to bear on
    people like Susan Collins, assuming she’s still in the Senate at the
    end of this race.

  - michelle goldberg  
    I feel like I could see something maybe mildly reassuring, which is
    out of character for me, which is that usually raising the salience
    of an issue like mail-in voting is a pretty difficult thing to do.
    It’s hard to get people excited about these procedural issues. The
    one useful thing that Trump has done by being both so blatant about
    the reason that he’s sabotaging the post office, and by just
    sabotaging the post office in a way that affects the lives of a lot
    of people who don’t follow politics very closely, is that people
    understand what’s going on. Even if they don’t understand all the
    nuances of it, they understand that they’re not getting their mail.
    They understand that they’re not getting their prescriptions. They
    understand that checks that they need are coming late. And so it has
    raised the public salience of an issue that otherwise might seem
    like a bit of procedural minutia.

  - jamelle bouie  
    There’s a lot that complain about the fact that cable news media is
    responsible for reporting election results. Every state has a
    Secretary of State’s office, but people get the results by way of
    the media. But the advantage in this case is that everyone gets the
    results by way of the media. And so if there’s just a collective
    agreement among the non-Fox networks to say we’re not going to
    report percentage precincts. We’re going to report the amount of the
    vote that has come in. We’re not going to do projected winners until
    a certain percentage of the vote that we know probably went out has
    come in. Those sorts of things, if there’s a general agreement to do
    them, I think will help. Because in 2000, it was the opposite.
    Networks were rushing to get ahead of each other in announcing who
    won and who didn’t. And that actually helped create the space for
    the shenanigans in Florida.

  - frank bruni  
    And maybe we all learned a lesson we won’t create that space this
    time around. There’s been a lot of kind of apocalyptic sentiment
    during the last few minutes of this. So I want to wrap up our
    discussion by leaving our listeners on a slightly maybe more
    positive, optimistic note. I want to ask each of you, and take it in
    whatever order you like, what are you seeing at this convention or
    what are you seeing in terms of the dynamics of this race that does
    give you great hope that the right thing will happen on November 3
    or in the days after November 3, as the count continues, and that we
    will get past these last four years? Why don’t we start with
    Michelle Cottle.

  - michelle cottle  
    Well, I think there’s clearly much less internal squabbling among
    Democrats. We do not have the small differences battles that were
    such a problem in 2016. And I think Hillary Clinton was an
    incredibly controversial candidate. I know lots of Democrats who
    just couldn’t even hold their nose and stomach her. So I think that
    Biden, for better and worse, does not incite those kind of passions.
    And so it’s been much easier on both levels, both from you know what
    the stakes are and the Biden isn’t scary. Much easier to bring the
    party together in this situation.

  - michelle goldberg  
    I just want to say quickly, I certainly know people who were
    enthusiastic about Hillary Clinton and are going to have a hard time
    voting for Joe Biden, even though they’re going to do it. So I don’t
    think that Joe Biden is completely anodyne as a candidate, although
    I agree, he partly just, as a white man, doesn’t inspire the sort of
    kind of panic and hysteria that Hillary Clinton has always inspired.
    So the thing that gives me a little bit of hope — and I’m not the
    person you turn to for hope — is as I said before, that I just think
    Democrats have wised up about relying on the courts and sort of
    procedural neutrality to sort this out. If you go back again and
    read about the Brooks Brothers riots and other sort of shenanigans
    around the 2000 election, Republicans had a multi-pronged strategy.
    They fought it in the courts, but they also fought it in the
    streets. They fought it in the court of public opinion. Democrats,
    at that time, really just had faith in the process and faith that
    the rules, neutrally applied, would see justice done. And I think
    that that is gone, and you have a lot of people now on hair trigger
    who don’t trust a lot of these institutions. They certainly don’t
    trust the courts. And so there’s going to be much more of an uproar
    if you see anything unfair, anything sort of un-kosher about the way
    that the vote is administered or the vote is counted. I just think
    that the Democratic base is much more activated and much more
    attuned and kind of much more ready to take to the streets.

  - jamelle bouie  
    Somewhat counterintuitively, my ray of hope is exactly that Trump is
    trying to corrupt and destroy the election. This is not something
    that a confident authoritarian does. It’s not something that a
    confident candidate does. It reflects profound fear and insecurity,
    that Trump almost certainly knows that by any conventional measure,
    he’s losing the election, that he knows that the public is against
    him. That’s why he’s been hyping up these boat parades, flotillas of
    supporters, that the real popular vote is the people who own boats
    and who fly Trump flags. But I think he and his team are very aware
    of what the political mood is against him. And so these, to me, kind
    of desperate attempts to shift the ground on which the election is
    actually being fought — obviously, there should be vigilance and
    preparation — but it should also I think convince Trump’s opponents
    — not just Democrats, but sort of the broad anti-Trump coalition —
    that they’re moving in the right direction and that they have the
    initiative here, that they’re not on the defensive at the end of the
    day. I would be worried if Trump seemed super confident. That would
    fill me with fear because that’s sort of the I’m doing something
    that you people don’t know about, are not going to know about, may
    not ever be able to prove. But flailing like a child, that actually
    makes me feel a little more confident.

  - frank bruni  
    That gives you your hope. I tell you what gives me hope. This
    convention gives me hope, in the sense that at every turn— every 15
    minutes, every five minutes — someone says something that tells me
    that people appreciate the stakes here. Even though everyone in 2016
    who was for Hillary Clinton and who was worried about Donald Trump
    certainly didn’t think he was just any Republican who might win, I
    still think the sense of stakes this time around that this is a
    crossroads, that we can’t go down the wrong fork in the road, that
    this is a kind of do-or-die moment for America, I’m hearing that
    loud and clear in this convention. And that gives me some hope that
    voters will bring the right urgency to November 3 and do the right
    thing. Let’s stop there. We are going to take a short break, and we
    will be back.
    
    And we’re back. And it’s that time when someone gives you all a
    recommendation to leave with. This week, I believe Michelle Cottle
    has something for us. Michelle, you have a recommendation?

  - michelle cottle  
    I do, and it might work best for parents. But you know, it could be
    adapted in some way. So obviously, I cover national politics for the
    board, so I just can’t live in that 24/7. So I have two teenagers. I
    have a 15-year-old daughter who’s a Broadway drama nerd and a
    17-year-old son who plays any instrument and is in his heavy classic
    rock phase. So he knows more about ‘70s and ‘80s music than I do.
    And one extremely effective way to waste time and get my mind a wash
    is we have Sonos on our phones that connects to a stereo speaker in
    the house. And you each take turns picking songs and playing them.
    And so you get into this kind of groove where everybody goes and
    starts picking the music, and then you start fighting over whose
    music is the worst or who’s the best or who did this guitar riff
    better than whatever. And then if my husband gets involved, he likes
    to sing. He’s a frustrated Broadway diva. And so then the children
    are appalled, and they’re, like, yelling at me to make dad stop. And
    so it can go on like this for hours. And for those who have
    teenagers, my teenagers spend most of their time sleeping until 2 pm
    and then staring at their screens during this pandemic because they
    have nowhere to go. So this is a fun way to get everybody kind of
    thinking about something that they love. And I don’t sing, but that
    makes it even more fun for them because they can abuse me
    mercilessly when I feel compelled to break into song.

  - frank bruni  
    It’s sort of like an old-fashioned jukebox.

  - michelle cottle  
    It is a jukebox. And you can cut off each other because you can
    break in with your phones on each other’s song. And at some point,
    it always degenerates into someone playing “What’s New Pussycat” at
    top volume. \[GOLDBERG LAUGHS\] I will not go into the whys of that.
    But at that point, you know it’s time to go to bed, really. It’s
    over.

  - frank bruni  
    Michelle, Jamelle, you both have children. Does this sound like fun
    for your whole families?

  - michelle goldberg  
    I mean, the time that we listen to music, we panic-bought a car
    during the pandemic. And so now we drive, which my kids aren’t used
    to. And they hate it, and they complain the whole time. But
    especially my five-year-old has very pronounced musical tastes. And
    the other day, for the first time, they asked us to play a song that
    we weren’t familiar with, “Exile” by Taylor Swift, which is actually
    a great song. And I’m not quite sure where they heard it. But it’s
    kind of fascinating to watch them develop musical personalities that
    are not just the albums that we’ve introduced them to.

  - frank bruni  
    Jamelle, you have just been made an honorary member of the Cottle
    family, and you are playing the Sonos challenge. What song are you
    queuing up?

  - jamelle bouie  
    I am cueing up “Girls On Film” by Duran Duran.

  - frank bruni  
    Wow.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Wow.

  - frank bruni  
    Duran Duran, I’m back in college. Yeesh. Michelle Cottle, Jamelle,
    thank you both so much for coming on the show this convention week,
    and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Yeah, thank you, guys.

  - jamelle bouie  
    Thank you for having us.

  - frank bruni  
    Meanwhile, Michelle Goldberg and I will be back next week. That’s
    our show for this week. Thank you all for listening. If you have a

  - jamelle bouie  
    I was about to say the two Michelle’s. But I wasn’t exactly sure, is
    that OK to say?

  - michelle cottle  
    No, that’s good.

  - jamelle bouie  
    OK.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Yeah, it’s not like it’s Karen. \[ALL
LAUGH\]

## What Biden Must Do

### With Jamelle Bouie, Frank Bruni, Michelle Cottle and Michelle Goldberg

#### A special round-table episode on what’s at stake during this week’s Democratic convention. Plus: a requiem for the “nerd Coachella.”

Thursday, August 20th, 2020

</div>

  - michelle goldberg  
    I’m Michelle Goldberg.

  - michelle cottle  
    I’m Michelle Cottle.

  - jamelle bouie  
    I’m Jamelle Bouie.

  - frank bruni  
    And I’m Frank Bruni, and this is “The Argument.”
    
    The Democratic convention is finally here, if you can even call it a
    convention. Like all else about a presidential campaign conducted in
    the shadow of a pandemic, it’s nothing like what happened in years
    past. Does that negate its usefulness? What can and should Democrats
    accomplish through this socially-distanced virtual extravaganza?
    
    To answer these questions, we’re doing something a little different
    today. Four of us are hosting the show, but none of the four is
    Ross, who’s on vacation. And we’re gathering on Tuesday morning
    after the first night of the convention. So we’re in the middle of a
    news event, which means plenty is going to happen after this
    recording. But whatever transpires, there are questions that will
    endure between now and election day and the morning after. They’re
    questions about the Biden-Harris ticket, about the state of the
    Democratic party, and about the threats to the election. So with no
    further throat-clearing, let me welcome our guest co-hosts — Jamelle
    Bouie, a columnist on the opinion desk, and Michelle Cottle, a
    member of our editorial board. Welcome to you both.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Yeah, welcome, you guys.

  - jamelle bouie  
    Hello.

  - michelle cottle  
    Excellent to be here.

  - frank bruni  
    So let’s get right into it, starting with Kamala Harris. She seems
    to have excited people about November, and excitement was something
    that the Biden campaign was sorely lacking up to this point. I want
    to know what you all made of this pick, what its pros and cons are.
    And so I’m going to start with you, Jamelle. Were you happy with
    this pick, in a strategic sense?

  - jamelle bouie  
    Sure. I can’t say that I was happy or unhappy about the pick. My
    range of emotions, with regards to politics, don’t really go in that
    spectrum. \[GOLDBERG LAUGHS\] But as far as thinking through the
    meaning of the pick, I think, as a political pick, it makes a lot of
    sense. And I think among the broader Democratic electorate, Harris
    is a pretty popular figure, a pretty well-liked figure. It may
    marginally increase the number in turnout for African-Americans and
    other groups. I think the weakness of the pick may come if Biden
    wins and takes office and it’s time to govern. Because I think one
    of Harris’s weaknesses during the primary was it wasn’t really quite
    sure what her vision was for governing the country. And given that a
    Biden administration will have to start immediately — no time for
    trying to figure things out, this is a running start — I think it
    matters that Harris, as a political figure, doesn’t seem to have
    some sort overarching vision for government, especially given the
    unusually high likelihood that she’ll end up taking over for Biden
    at some point, given his age.

  - michelle cottle  
    So for me, I was pleased by the pick. But more than that, I was
    relieved. What I wanted was for whoever was chosen to not be
    surprising, at least for people who watch politics even remotely
    closely. I didn’t want it to be a story that derailed everything.
    You don’t want this campaign, as it’s going right now, to get
    dramatically shifted because someone super out of the blue gets put
    on the ticket. And this sounds weird to say because, obviously, she
    is the first African-American woman who is in this position, but she
    was a completely unsurprising pick, almost the safe pick. She’s run
    for high office and been publicly vetted at a level that a lot of
    the people who were considered front-runners were not. It also was a
    nice signal that he’s not going to hold a grudge. Considering how
    petty the sitting president is, for Biden to have overlooked the
    early squabbling between him and Kamala, it just sent a nice signal.
    And then, of course, she is exciting, on some level. This is going
    beyond the usual ticket of two boring old white guys. It’s not
    exactly what the progressive left would have hoped for, but I think
    it does what it needs to do.

  - frank bruni  
    Michelle Goldberg, I want to kind of pivot off of Michelle Cottle’s
    mention of the progressive left. Before this choice, there was a lot
    of talk about progressives having issues with Kamala. And it seems
    to me, but tell me if I’m not seeing it correctly, that since the
    choice, there’s been real unity. People have fallen in line. Is that
    your take on it, or what do you make of the progressive reaction
    thus far to Kamala’s presence on the ticket?

  - michelle goldberg  
    Well, look, I think that there was always going to be sort of
    hardcore Bernie people who were very disappointed by Kamala,
    although people often forget. It’s kind of funny that we talk about
    Kamala as if she was some moderate when, by a lot of measures, she’s
    one of the most progressive senators. But she has kind of a
    troubling criminal justice record. She’s not as progressive as some
    of the other candidates on issues like Israel that matter a lot to a
    kind of incoming cohort of young progressives. She’s seen as closer
    to Wall Street certainly than Elizabeth Warren. My sense is that the
    Biden camp — I don’t know if they did this deliberately, but they
    were very, very smart, I think, to make it seem like it was going to
    be Susan Rice. Because that meant that when it was Kamala, almost
    everybody could feel a sense of relief, including people on the
    left. And I also think Bernie Sanders himself has played a really
    helpful role here, right? Bernie Sanders has endorsed this pick and
    so have other people who have credibility on the left. And then
    finally, I think that just seeing a lot of progressive black women
    who were really, really moved and overjoyed by this. And kind of
    seeing that made it a little bit harder for some other people, I
    think, on the left to quibble overly much because you just sort of
    had to recognize what this meant for a lot of people that are
    admired on the left. The funny thing about this pick is that before
    the entire primary started, if you would asked I think a lot of
    people, what is the most likely Democratic ticket? They would have
    said Biden-Harris. And so we just went through so much drama, the
    ups and downs of the presidential campaign, of the vice presidential
    search to end up pretty much exactly where it always seemed like we
    were going.

  - frank bruni  
    It’s like that line in Edward Albee’s “The Zoo Story,” sometimes you
    have to go a long way out of the way to come a short way back.
    \[GOLDBERG LAUGHS\] That’s the story of the Democratic primary. We
    could talk for a long time about Kamala and about this ticket. But
    because we’ve got so much ground to cover, you just mentioned Bernie
    Sanders. He was there on the first night of the Democratic
    convention — or maybe one of you as a better noun. I’m not sure what
    we’re supposed to call this virtual event. But I’m really curious to
    hear what you all made of the event, given the difficulty of doing
    this without an arena, without a crowd that’s clapping and
    screaming, whether you thought the choreography of it worked, or
    whether you think this convention is going to end up mattering less
    than conventions ever have because of the coronavirus-mandated
    adaptations.

  - michelle cottle  
    Well, I had talked to the convention planners about this, and they
    had been thinking of ways to make it less — not staged, I guess, but
    even before they kind of knew what they were going to be dealing
    with the virus, they wanted to get more regular people in there. And
    I thought that the clips from people talking about their dreams and
    fears and hardships was actually kind of a good addition. These
    conventions tend to be about a lot of schmoozing and stuff behind
    the scenes. And then the public face of them is a long series of
    really boring, for the most part, speeches. And it’s like a big
    advertisement for the party. I do think that particularly in this
    moment, it helps to have a little bit of a reminder of what real
    people are going through. And because they couldn’t have everybody
    in Milwaukee and they were going to have to do it virtually anyway,
    you might as well take advantage of different people, different
    places.

  - frank bruni  
    Jamelle, you wrote in the great scorecard that “The Times” does with
    various people, grading what’s happening at the convention, you
    thought Bernie Sanders was a real highlight and his speech was
    particularly important. Why is that so, not just in terms of the
    first night of the convention, but in terms of now going through
    Nov. 3?

  - jamelle bouie  
    So I’ve been listening to Bernie Sanders speeches in one form or
    another for five years, and they typically have kind of the same
    rhythm to them and they hit the same themes. And I thought this one
    was interesting and notable in that it wasn’t really a typical
    Bernie Sanders speech at all, and it was very much the sort of plea
    for coalition-building, right? That one at the very beginning that
    he’ll work with anyone, even conservative Republicans, to stop Trump
    I thought was very important. Given that the political theme of the
    convention is essentially that Biden is leading a silent majority of
    anti-Trump Americans across kind of a demographic and political
    spectrum, having Sanders as the most prominent left-wing voice in
    American politics say that was really important. I thought it hit
    the exact right note of impressing upon listeners just the stakes of
    the election and the stakes of letting Trump win again. I thought
    Michelle Obama’s speech, on a similar point, did the same thing.

  - frank bruni  
    Michelle Obama was, as expected, extraordinary. I was really struck,
    in terms of Sanders, his tone, which you’re right to focus on, felt
    so different to me from 2016. I mean, he said vote for Hillary back
    then. The words were correct. The script was what it was supposed to
    be. But I sensed this time around from Bernie Sanders, and really
    kind of from the whole party, a whole new appreciation of the
    stakes. And Michelle Goldberg, it gave me some real hope that
    between now and Nov. 3 and on Nov. 3, we may see no repeat of what
    happened in 2016. Am I just being a ridiculous optimist, or do you
    have that same hope?

  - michelle goldberg  
    No, I mean, I think that I have that same hope. I think there might
    be a fair number of people who didn’t vote in 2016 not even out of
    some sort of deep ideological aversion to Hillary Clinton, but just
    out of a sense that they didn’t care that much for her and they
    thought it was in the bag, right? They didn’t foresee this utter
    catastrophe, this utter destruction of most of our day-to-day lives.
    And so yes, I think it’s very hard for anyone to pull the kind of
    tweedle-dum, tweedle-dee thing that certain people on the left have
    been pulling for most of my adult life. That said, one of the
    interesting things about doing a convention this way is that it
    gives a lot less power to grassroots activists, for better or worse.
    The kind of people who disrupted the convention in 2016 because they
    were angry about the treatment of Bernie Sanders, because they were
    angry about some of the revelations in the emails that were hacked
    by the Russians at Trump’s behest, they just didn’t have a say in
    this, right? So there was this kind of interesting duality to it. On
    the one hand, you do hear in this convention from a lot more, quote
    unquote, “ordinary people,” people outside of politics. On the other
    hand, ordinary activists have basically no say in how things proceed
    because they can’t start cheers or chants or interrupting. And so it
    feels more sort of homespun but is actually a much more kind of
    produced and polished affair.

  - frank bruni  
    In terms of Democratic messaging and that which they can control,
    what do you think they need to accomplish in this convention and
    going forward to maximize the chances of the most votes on November
    3?

  - jamelle bouie  
    I think maybe the important thing that needs to happen, with regards
    to the entire convention, is the less about what is said and more
    about how what is said is reported. Because what we’ve sort of
    learned over the past four years is that earned media, how coverage
    goes out to the public is actually really important to shaping voter
    perceptions. You could make a good case that Biden is the nominee
    because the one-two punch of South Carolina and all those
    endorsements created this wave of positive earned media that drove
    the Democratic primary electorate to his side. And so to the extent
    that this convention presents a Democratic party that is unified,
    that is big tent, plenty of room for lots of different people of
    many different beliefs. To the extent that it shows a Democratic
    party that has a strongly contrasting message with the president,
    then I think it does its job. And I think it leaves the kind of
    impression you want voters to have. But beyond that, the specific
    things said, I don’t know. The general impression, that’s important.

  - frank bruni  
    I think that’s a great point about earned media, by which, for the
    listeners who aren’t up on the jargon, we mean the reporting that
    happens independent of a political campaign’s chosen ads and stuff
    like that. But you’re seeing, apart from the programming at the
    convention, a lot of stories right now about how many Republicans
    have turned their backs on Trump and are actually campaigning for
    Biden. And that’s the great example of what the party is programming
    and talking about ends up going out into a thousand other media
    channels and reaching the public in different ways.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Also most people are not going to be watching this in a multi-hour
    block. So a lot of what matters is the little clips that get
    repurposed and shown on the news and shown on talk shows.
    Journalists are going to watch the convention in totality, and
    what’s going to matter for how it resonates is these kind of
    little moments that become almost memes or become, as you said,
    earned media. I miss real conventions. I see a lot of people, kind
    of cynical journalists, saying, like, oh yeah, conventions suck, and
    so much nicer to watch them from your couch. I actually love
    political conventions — maybe not Republican ones, certainly not
    anymore. People used to call the White House Correspondents Dinner
    “nerd prom.” The Democratic convention is like “nerd Coachella.”
    You see people that you haven’t seen in forever. There’s all these
    tertiary events. Except for the big headline speeches, there’s five
    different places you could be at any one time. And so you experience
    it in this much more fragmentary way. I think that it’s not ideal to
    have a convention like this, from the party’s perspective. But the
    party does have much, much more control in this format of what to
    highlight. Often, these speeches would happen, and the live coverage
    would break away because you’re button-holing people in the hallway
    to interview different people in the party. They have much more
    control over the message in this format, and that could end up being
    good for them.

  - frank bruni  
    Michelle Cottle, the climax, the headline act of this virtual nerd
    Coachella is Joe Biden’s speech on Thursday night. You have written
    extensively and wonderfully about the various influences on Joe
    Biden, about his sort of path through the primary to this point.
    What are you expecting, and what are you wanting from it? What can
    he accomplish with this speech that he maybe hasn’t accomplished yet
    but needs to?

  - michelle cottle  
    I don’t think he needs to do a lot of complicated things. I think,
    as with the message of the convention in general, he needs to convey
    the basics of compassion and competence. Now, he has a leg up, at
    this point, because the Trump campaign has basically painted him as
    a drooling imbecile sitting in his basement unable to string a
    sentence together. So all he needs to do, on some level, is clear
    that hurdle. He just needs to not pass out during his speech. But he
    needs to convey what I think people look to him for during the
    primary, which is a sense of humanity, a sense of empathy. That is
    something that, obviously, has been sorely lacking with the current
    administration. And the message of all these real people that
    they’re spotlighting at the convention talking about what they’ve
    been through is to kind of send the signal that this is the
    candidate who cares about this and who will actually take steps to
    improve your lives, that he cares about something other than his own
    ambitions and his own power. So I think just of conveying that, I
    feel your pain, I’m going to fix this. And then, of course, being
    not scary, and this is where the reaching out to Republicans, to
    progressives, the big-tent message will come into this. He has
    stressed that he wants to work with everyone. There is a place for
    everyone in his party. So I think all of those kind of basic things
    need to come through in the speech. He does not have to be Barack
    Obama. He is not a rhetorical god at this point, and he doesn’t even
    need to try that. So he just needs to let Joe be Joe, on some level.

  - frank bruni  
    Michelle Goldberg, you made the great point that this convention
    gives Democrats more control than ever before because it’s not
    happening at an arena, people aren’t standing up able to do whatever
    they want to do. Is it going to matter in the end? And in terms of
    it having to have been reinvented and abbreviated and crunched, do
    you think this might be the beginning of conventions mattering less?

  - michelle goldberg  
    I mean, I think it’s really hard to say, right? So it’s interesting
    to me to hear Jamelle be so sort of Spock-like in his response to
    this. And I’m curious about whether, Jamelle, have you always been
    like this, or was it the trauma of 2016? Because we were together at
    the conventions four years ago, and I feel like I had a lot of
    feelings. Maybe I was just projecting them onto you. But I remember
    being at the Democratic convention, and I wrote about this at the
    time, it was impeccable. Joe Biden gave one of the best speeches
    I’ve ever heard him give at that convention. Michelle Obama gave
    an amazing speech. Compared to the total shit show of Trump’s
    convention, which was this kind of pathetic shambolic thing with
    Scott Baio talking and a bunch of Nazis outside, I don’t think even
    the best-produced convention can change the political dynamics in
    the country. I do think a couple of things. I think first of all,
    conventions, beyond what they do for a candidate a couple months
    before the election, it’s good for a party to come together. It’s
    good for people to build these relationships. That’s why you have
    conventions not just of political parties, but of all sorts of
    organizations. It fosters cohesion. And so for that reason, I really
    hope that they resume them once they can. I also think that, again,
    because Donald Trump has chosen this particular attack on Joe Biden
    — that he’s senile, that he can’t talk, that he has to be hidden
    away from view — if he just gives a kind of mildly competent speech,
    a sort of ordinary, boilerplate political acceptance speech, it will
    do something to puncture that narrative. It seems — knock on wood —
    that it was potentially, from Trump’s point of view, a bad idea to
    lower expectations about your opponent to such levels.

  - frank bruni  
    I was just going to echo the points that both Michelle Goldberg and
    Michelle Cottle made that it’s really strange, just from a political
    strategy standpoint, to attack your opponent as a bumbling idiot and
    someone incapable of stringing together a sentence ahead of a major
    event where people will see that candidate string together a
    sentence, a series of sentences, and appear competent. If there’s
    any political advantage in this moment that the Democratic ticket
    has is that the Republican attacks — the Trump attacks, specifically
    — are just so removed from reality that once people get any kind of
    direct contact with that ticket, they’re going to be like, oh, well
    obviously the Trump campaign is full of crap, right? So Biden is a
    drooling imbecile, not going to be the case. Kamala Harris is an
    anti-police radical, people are going to see her speak and be like,
    that’s nonsense. It’s not going to be the case. The ticket as a
    whole is in the thrall of leftists, well, we just saw John Kasich
    give a four minute speech, so that’s probably not true. And I think
    the Trump campaign, because it cannot actually campaign on its
    record or on current conditions, is throwing everything at the wall
    and will find that that just doesn’t work, that a voting public
    actually wants to hear about what each ticket has to say about
    things happening now and that the Democratic ticket is mainstream to
    a fault, you could say. There’s nothing there that’s going to cause
    people to think, oh, these people are dangerous or radical.

  - michelle goldberg  
    But Jamelle, can I ask you a question? Both of us have seen Joe
    Biden speak a lot of times, and he’s pretty hit or miss. Like I
    said, in 2016, I thought he gave one of the best speeches at the
    convention. I’ve seen him give speeches on the campaign trail that
    left me with my heart in my throat, feeling like I was watching an
    actor forgetting his lines. This is such an important moment. Do you
    have any anxiety about how it’s going to come off?

  - jamelle bouie  
    He’s always done worse in his impromptu moments. But a prepared
    speech, he’s perfectly competent of giving. He’s been giving them
    for his entire adult life. So I’m not too worried about that. The
    things I’m worried about have really less to do with the Democratic
    ticket or with the Democratic coalition, although there are, of
    course, tensions and divides to talk about within that coalition.
    But the things I’m worried about have just much more to do with
    election administration and the entire process of the election and
    how that’s going to interact with the president’s, I think, clear
    efforts to delegitimize the outcome and also the Republican Party,
    how it relates to those attempts, right? Because for as much as the
    conversation has been about Trump’s attacks on the election, kind of
    the key actor on Nov. 3 and Nov. 4, depending on the outcome, will
    just be Republican-elected officials, how they react to what’s
    happened.

  - frank bruni  
    That’s a great point, Jamelle. Let’s use that as a pivot because
    this convention is four days in time. It will recede in the rearview
    mirror really quickly. But all around it — and Michelle Goldberg,
    you just wrote about this — we have this very clear evidence that
    Trump is cheating, is preparing to cheat yet more. We have this huge
    melodrama with the United States Postal Service. We have various
    other things the president has said and done to convince people that
    if the result of this election is not what they want, they can
    consider it illegitimate. How much does each of you, and let’s start
    with Michelle Cottle, worry about this truly being anything close to
    a free and fair election?

  - michelle cottle  
    Oh, I’m completely terrified on some level. Cheater’s gonna cheat.
    And I think that they’ve made clear they have no problem with doing
    whatever is necessary to undermine the process. I also worry about
    what happens if it is a remotely close election because all of
    President Trump’s efforts to delegitimize this become that much more
    of an issue if they are like, oh, well look, it was so close. They
    cheated. It’s all the systemic fraud from the mail-in voting. I
    think that the larger the margin is, the easier it will be for at
    least respectable Republican officials to say, OK, we need to move
    on, even if that infuriates certain segments of the base.

  - frank bruni  
    That’s what Michelle Obama was saying on Monday night at the
    convention. I thought one of the most fascinating parts of that
    extraordinary, excellent speech was when she was essentially saying,
    get your ballot tonight. Mail it in now, or prepare to go. Pack
    dinner and breakfast in case you have to wait on line. She was
    basically saying to America, you have got to deliver the
    Biden-Harris ticket such a margin that the cheating is erased and
    that there’s no ability for Donald Trump to say that this is a
    fraudulent result. I mean, that was such a kind of appropriately
    cynical instruction to the American public, don’t you think?

  - michelle goldberg  
    Well, and it’s not just the numbers that matter. It’s also the
    timing. Jamelle wrote about this that right now, there’s this
    asymmetry. And the Democrats are saying that they’re more likely to
    vote by mail because they are more likely to take coronavirus
    seriously and Republicans the opposite. And what that could end up
    meaning is if you look back to 2018, in the midterms, and on
    election night, it looked like Democrats had had a really
    disappointing night. And it took the days and weeks afterwards, as
    the full vote was counted, to realize that there really was a blue
    wave. If something like that happens with Trump, he’s extremely
    likely to just declare victory on election night and to try to shut
    down the vote count afterwards. And so if you think about, for those
    of us who are old enough to remember 2000, what happened with the
    fight over the recount in Florida and you multiply that by many
    states or many jurisdictions, and think back to the fact that Roger
    Stone, Trump’s criminal advisor, was involved in basically staging
    what is now known as the Brooks Brothers riot where a bunch of rowdy
    Republican operatives physically interfered with the vote count in a
    way that very likely changed the course of that election, while
    hapless Democrats relied on the courts. I do think that Democrats
    are not going to do that this time. They’re not just going to assume
    that the rule of law will prevail and the courts will protect them.
    And as I wrote today, people are already sort of organizing for the
    mass protest that’s going to be necessary if there is some sort of
    shenanigans with the vote count or if Trump tries to interfere
    within in some way. In 2016, the night Trump was elected, when I was
    envisioning all sorts of disasters, could I have imagined that he
    would try to destroy the post office in order to stop people from
    casting their ballots? Probably not. And so I don’t think we should
    assume that that is the last important American institution that he
    will use his power to try and wreck if he thinks that his holding
    onto power depends on it.

  - frank bruni  
    Right, so there are things that are outside of the Democratic
    party’s control. What can and should it do between now and
    November 3 to try to prevent the worst happening, to try to make
    this election as free and fair as it can possibly be? Jamelle, do
    you have any thoughts on that?

  - jamelle bouie  
    Yeah, I mean, I think Michelle Goldberg got to much of what would be
    included in that. It is first, providing for voters detailed
    instructions on how to get a ballot, how to cast a ballot, how to do
    it in person. It’s organizing efforts for people who need to go in
    person, to bring them in person. I think it would probably include
    distributing masks and stuff to voters who want them to kind of help
    people get themselves prepared for standing in line. Similar to what
    the R.N.C. and the Trump campaign are doing, kind of a nationwide
    plan to contest vote counts, which they’ve sort of announced that
    this is part of their election plan. I think the Democratic party
    and its affiliated institutions and organizations need to be
    prepping basically a defense of ballot counting, sort of a
    nationwide effort to stop that tampering. I think there needs to be
    plans for protests and demonstrations. This is going to sound very
    hyperbolic, but I think that we have to think of the task of getting
    Trump out as less of a traditional democratic transition and more of
    something akin to pushing an authoritarian regime out. And that’s
    going to mean in addition to at the ballot box on Nov. 3, there
    being a Biden lead at the end of the night. Because I think Trump is
    going to contest regardless. Regardless of the outcome, Trump is
    going to say, this was rigged. This is fake, whatever. But the key
    thing is, is there space for the Republican legislature in
    Pennsylvania or Michigan or Wisconsin to certify election night
    results and send those in before all the votes are counted to force
    basically a contest between the full count that’s if a governor
    certifies and the partial count that the legislature does. And
    demonstrations, a large vote count on election night, all those
    sorts of things send an important signal to Republican legislators
    and officials that if they take this step, they will be taking a
    step that directly affects their ability to hold power in the
    future. That’s the message of a demonstration — not for Trump
    because Trump I don’t think gives a shit.

  - michelle cottle  
    Now, there’s also something that the media needs to do. They need to
    start setting expectations, just as Trump is very aggressively
    pushing the idea that election night has to be it. You have to call
    this race on election night. I think there needs to be a fair amount
    of pushback where people are told, this very well could go on past
    the one night that everybody thinks of as the deciding moment,
    especially if it’s not a huge margin. And people have talked about
    the blue shift, where Democratic votes have been coming in on the
    later side. So what starts out looking like a close call then widens
    to be a more comfortable Democratic margin. Trump’s going to go
    berserk over things like that, and people need to be prepared but
    that is not cheating. That is not rigging this vote, that election
    night is no longer a drop-dead kind of moment. Because he’s been
    pushing the idea that if it’s not called on that night, it’s fake.
    And that’s just something that everyone else has to say, no, that’s
    nonsense.

  - frank bruni  
    Can I push back on one thing? Everything you say is 100 percent
    true, but I want any one of you who can reassure me to reassure me.
    We can report that, Michelle. We at The Times, our colleagues at the
    Washington Post, people on the responsible cable networks can do
    everything you’re saying, and yet we live in an information
    ecosystem where we’re never going to reach some of the people who
    most need to hear exactly what you said. What do we do about that?

  - michelle cottle  
    You’re never going to get everybody. I mean, you don’t worry about
    something just because it’s not going to be 100 percent. But you’re
    also talking to Republican officials. You need to put the pressure
    on them. It needs to be one of these things where only the fraction
    of the base who is going to believe whatever, Trump shoot somebody
    on Fifth Avenue, they’re cool with that. Everybody else needs to
    know the reality of the situation. You can’t break into that weird
    alternative bubble with everything. But everybody else who’s not
    drinking the Kool-Aid needs to understand this. The more people you
    can get to understand it, the more pressure gets brought to bear on
    people like Susan Collins, assuming she’s still in the Senate at the
    end of this race.

  - michelle goldberg  
    I feel like I could see something maybe mildly reassuring, which is
    out of character for me, which is that usually raising the salience
    of an issue like mail-in voting is a pretty difficult thing to do.
    It’s hard to get people excited about these procedural issues. The
    one useful thing that Trump has done by being both so blatant about
    the reason that he’s sabotaging the post office, and by just
    sabotaging the post office in a way that affects the lives of a lot
    of people who don’t follow politics very closely, is that people
    understand what’s going on. Even if they don’t understand all the
    nuances of it, they understand that they’re not getting their mail.
    They understand that they’re not getting their prescriptions. They
    understand that checks that they need are coming late. And so it has
    raised the public salience of an issue that otherwise might seem
    like a bit of procedural minutia.

  - jamelle bouie  
    There’s a lot that complain about the fact that cable news media is
    responsible for reporting election results. Every state has a
    Secretary of State’s office, but people get the results by way of
    the media. But the advantage in this case is that everyone gets the
    results by way of the media. And so if there’s just a collective
    agreement among the non-Fox networks to say we’re not going to
    report percentage precincts. We’re going to report the amount of the
    vote that has come in. We’re not going to do projected winners until
    a certain percentage of the vote that we know probably went out has
    come in. Those sorts of things, if there’s a general agreement to do
    them, I think will help. Because in 2000, it was the opposite.
    Networks were rushing to get ahead of each other in announcing who
    won and who didn’t. And that actually helped create the space for
    the shenanigans in Florida.

  - frank bruni  
    And maybe we all learned a lesson we won’t create that space this
    time around. There’s been a lot of kind of apocalyptic sentiment
    during the last few minutes of this. So I want to wrap up our
    discussion by leaving our listeners on a slightly maybe more
    positive, optimistic note. I want to ask each of you, and take it in
    whatever order you like, what are you seeing at this convention or
    what are you seeing in terms of the dynamics of this race that does
    give you great hope that the right thing will happen on November 3
    or in the days after November 3, as the count continues, and that we
    will get past these last four years? Why don’t we start with
    Michelle Cottle.

  - michelle cottle  
    Well, I think there’s clearly much less internal squabbling among
    Democrats. We do not have the small differences battles that were
    such a problem in 2016. And I think Hillary Clinton was an
    incredibly controversial candidate. I know lots of Democrats who
    just couldn’t even hold their nose and stomach her. So I think that
    Biden, for better and worse, does not incite those kind of passions.
    And so it’s been much easier on both levels, both from you know what
    the stakes are and the Biden isn’t scary. Much easier to bring the
    party together in this situation.

  - michelle goldberg  
    I just want to say quickly, I certainly know people who were
    enthusiastic about Hillary Clinton and are going to have a hard time
    voting for Joe Biden, even though they’re going to do it. So I don’t
    think that Joe Biden is completely anodyne as a candidate, although
    I agree, he partly just, as a white man, doesn’t inspire the sort of
    kind of panic and hysteria that Hillary Clinton has always inspired.
    So the thing that gives me a little bit of hope — and I’m not the
    person you turn to for hope — is as I said before, that I just think
    Democrats have wised up about relying on the courts and sort of
    procedural neutrality to sort this out. If you go back again and
    read about the Brooks Brothers riots and other sort of shenanigans
    around the 2000 election, Republicans had a multi-pronged strategy.
    They fought it in the courts, but they also fought it in the
    streets. They fought it in the court of public opinion. Democrats,
    at that time, really just had faith in the process and faith that
    the rules, neutrally applied, would see justice done. And I think
    that that is gone, and you have a lot of people now on hair trigger
    who don’t trust a lot of these institutions. They certainly don’t
    trust the courts. And so there’s going to be much more of an uproar
    if you see anything unfair, anything sort of un-kosher about the way
    that the vote is administered or the vote is counted. I just think
    that the Democratic base is much more activated and much more
    attuned and kind of much more ready to take to the streets.

  - jamelle bouie  
    Somewhat counterintuitively, my ray of hope is exactly that Trump is
    trying to corrupt and destroy the election. This is not something
    that a confident authoritarian does. It’s not something that a
    confident candidate does. It reflects profound fear and insecurity,
    that Trump almost certainly knows that by any conventional measure,
    he’s losing the election, that he knows that the public is against
    him. That’s why he’s been hyping up these boat parades, flotillas of
    supporters, that the real popular vote is the people who own boats
    and who fly Trump flags. But I think he and his team are very aware
    of what the political mood is against him. And so these, to me, kind
    of desperate attempts to shift the ground on which the election is
    actually being fought — obviously, there should be vigilance and
    preparation — but it should also I think convince Trump’s opponents
    — not just Democrats, but sort of the broad anti-Trump coalition —
    that they’re moving in the right direction and that they have the
    initiative here, that they’re not on the defensive at the end of the
    day. I would be worried if Trump seemed super confident. That would
    fill me with fear because that’s sort of the I’m doing something
    that you people don’t know about, are not going to know about, may
    not ever be able to prove. But flailing like a child, that actually
    makes me feel a little more confident.

  - frank bruni  
    That gives you your hope. I tell you what gives me hope. This
    convention gives me hope, in the sense that at every turn— every 15
    minutes, every five minutes — someone says something that tells me
    that people appreciate the stakes here. Even though everyone in 2016
    who was for Hillary Clinton and who was worried about Donald Trump
    certainly didn’t think he was just any Republican who might win, I
    still think the sense of stakes this time around that this is a
    crossroads, that we can’t go down the wrong fork in the road, that
    this is a kind of do-or-die moment for America, I’m hearing that
    loud and clear in this convention. And that gives me some hope that
    voters will bring the right urgency to November 3 and do the right
    thing. Let’s stop there. We are going to take a short break, and we
    will be back.
    
    And we’re back. And it’s that time when someone gives you all a
    recommendation to leave with. This week, I believe Michelle Cottle
    has something for us. Michelle, you have a recommendation?

  - michelle cottle  
    I do, and it might work best for parents. But you know, it could be
    adapted in some way. So obviously, I cover national politics for the
    board, so I just can’t live in that 24/7. So I have two teenagers. I
    have a 15-year-old daughter who’s a Broadway drama nerd and a
    17-year-old son who plays any instrument and is in his heavy classic
    rock phase. So he knows more about ‘70s and ‘80s music than I do.
    And one extremely effective way to waste time and get my mind a wash
    is we have Sonos on our phones that connects to a stereo speaker in
    the house. And you each take turns picking songs and playing them.
    And so you get into this kind of groove where everybody goes and
    starts picking the music, and then you start fighting over whose
    music is the worst or who’s the best or who did this guitar riff
    better than whatever. And then if my husband gets involved, he likes
    to sing. He’s a frustrated Broadway diva. And so then the children
    are appalled, and they’re, like, yelling at me to make dad stop. And
    so it can go on like this for hours. And for those who have
    teenagers, my teenagers spend most of their time sleeping until 2 pm
    and then staring at their screens during this pandemic because they
    have nowhere to go. So this is a fun way to get everybody kind of
    thinking about something that they love. And I don’t sing, but that
    makes it even more fun for them because they can abuse me
    mercilessly when I feel compelled to break into song.

  - frank bruni  
    It’s sort of like an old-fashioned jukebox.

  - michelle cottle  
    It is a jukebox. And you can cut off each other because you can
    break in with your phones on each other’s song. And at some point,
    it always degenerates into someone playing “What’s New Pussycat” at
    top volume. \[GOLDBERG LAUGHS\] I will not go into the whys of that.
    But at that point, you know it’s time to go to bed, really. It’s
    over.

  - frank bruni  
    Michelle, Jamelle, you both have children. Does this sound like fun
    for your whole families?

  - michelle goldberg  
    I mean, the time that we listen to music, we panic-bought a car
    during the pandemic. And so now we drive, which my kids aren’t used
    to. And they hate it, and they complain the whole time. But
    especially my five-year-old has very pronounced musical tastes. And
    the other day, for the first time, they asked us to play a song that
    we weren’t familiar with, “Exile” by Taylor Swift, which is actually
    a great song. And I’m not quite sure where they heard it. But it’s
    kind of fascinating to watch them develop musical personalities that
    are not just the albums that we’ve introduced them to.

  - frank bruni  
    Jamelle, you have just been made an honorary member of the Cottle
    family, and you are playing the Sonos challenge. What song are you
    queuing up?

  - jamelle bouie  
    I am cueing up “Girls On Film” by Duran Duran.

  - frank bruni  
    Wow.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Wow.

  - frank bruni  
    Duran Duran, I’m back in college. Yeesh. Michelle Cottle, Jamelle,
    thank you both so much for coming on the show this convention week,
    and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future.

  - michelle goldberg

  - jamelle bouie  
    I was about to say the two Michelle’s. But I wasn’t exactly sure, is
    that OK to say?

  - michelle cottle  
    No, that’s good.

  - jamelle bouie  
    OK.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Yeah, it’s not like it’s Karen. \[ALL LAUGH\]

It’s a Democratic convention unlike any other. So who is it for? What
does the party, and its presidential candidate, Joe Biden, need to
accomplish? And how should they approach President Trump’s threats to a
free and fair election? This week on the podcast, Frank Bruni and
Michelle Goldberg are joined by Opinion columnist Jamelle Bouie and
editorial board member Michelle Cottle for a round-table discussion of
the virtual “nerd Coachella” that is the Democratic National Convention
of 2020.

Then, Michelle Cottle offers a homespun jukebox game that can take the
whole family’s mind off politics and the pandemic.

I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist for The Times since 2011, but my career
with the newspaper stretches back to 1995 and includes many twists and
turns that reflect my embarrassingly scattered interests. I covered
Congress, the White House and several political campaigns; I also spent
five years in the role of chief restaurant critic. As the Rome bureau
chief, I reported on the Vatican; as a staff writer for The Times’s
Sunday magazine, I wrote many celebrity profiles. That jumble has
informed my various books, which focus on the Roman Catholic Church,
George W. Bush, my strange eating life, the college admissions process
and meatloaf. Politically, I’m grief-stricken over the way President
Trump has governed and I’m left of center, but I don’t think that the
center is a bad place or “compromise” a dirty word. I’m
Italian-American, I’m gay and I write a [weekly Times
newsletter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/newsletters/frank-bruni)
in which you’ll occasionally encounter my dog, Regan, who has the run of
our Manhattan apartment.

I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing
mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the
right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s
basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency
has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books,
including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its
religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global
battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics,
about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.)
I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we
spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our
son and daughter.
