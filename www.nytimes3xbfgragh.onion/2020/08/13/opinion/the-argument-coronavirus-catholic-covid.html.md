## Is Individualism America’s Religion?

### With Frank Bruni and Ross Douthat

  - frank bruni  
    I’m Frank Bruni.

  - ross douthat  
    I’m Ross Douthat, and this is “The Argument.” \[THEME MUSIC PLAYS\]
    
    Today, a conversation about where we stand with COVID-19. Can the
    U.S. still contain its spread, or are we already defeated? Then
    nearly 1/5 of all Americans identify as Catholic, but can their
    church say “Black Lives Matter“?
    
    Frank, welcome back.

  - frank bruni  
    Hey, Ross.

  - ross douthat  
    So I think our listeners may be especially glad to hear your voice,
    after last week’s all-conservative spectacular, \[BRUNI LAUGHS\] in
    which I was the moderate squish, arguing with more pro-Trump
    conservatives. Did you give it a listen?

  - frank bruni  
    I did, and all-conservative spectacular was not the phrase that came
    immediately to mind. It was an interesting experience, Ross.

  - ross douthat  
    That’s all I can ask, Frank.

  - frank bruni  
    I wanted to be there. I wished I could have inserted myself ever so
    briefly, just to kind of ask your guests, who seemed to think Trump
    had done a good job managing the pandemic, what they make of our
    world-leading case counts and death totals and how they explain
    that. But seriously though, I agreed with many listeners who wrote
    in and said that it was a discussion they wouldn’t normally get to
    hear. It’s the kind of thing that they hoped to hear when they
    turned to our show, something that hadn’t crossed their radar before
    and they might not have thought of. And if it’s OK, Ross, I want to
    read what one reader named Donna wrote in because I thought it was
    very interesting. She says, “I found the latest right-wing coup
    episode one of your best ever. I like to hear both sides of an
    argument. Your show provides that, to an extent. But Ross often
    seems outnumbered and ganged up on by Michelle and Frank. I would
    like to know more about far-right views, but it’s difficult for me
    to listen to Fox News opinion segments or AM talk radio for all the
    interruptions, over-speaking, and name-calling.” So that’s a pretty
    great endorsement, Ross.

  - ross douthat  
    There’s very little name-calling on our show, and we’re proud of it.

  - frank bruni  
    No, you and I only call each other names after we turn off the
    microphones.

  - ross douthat  
    Yeah, or our producers—

  - frank bruni  
    I’m kidding. I’m kidding.

  - ross douthat  
    —call both of us terrible names.

  - frank bruni  
    Well, that’s for sure, yeah.

  - ross douthat  
    Well, I appreciate Donna’s take. I know not every listener probably
    had the same take, and I suspect Michelle herself probably had a
    slightly different one. But she’s off this week, and I will be
    suspiciously and conveniently on vacation next week. So it’ll be a
    little while before I get to hear her take. Anyway, let’s get to
    this week’s episode. For our first segment, we’re joined by Jeneen
    Interlandi, who writes about health and science for opinions
    editorial board and for The New York Times Magazine. Listeners may
    remember her voice from way back in March when we were wondering if
    quarantine would last through the end of that month. Back then,
    Jeneen told us to hunker down. She said the virus wasn’t likely to
    go anywhere through at least the end of the year. And at the time,
    that seemed — well, for a lot of people — tough to imagine. And yet,
    here we are, still in limbo, waiting on a vaccine with more than 5
    million cases since March, more than 162,000 dead, the federal
    government gridlocked, and a state-by-state patchwork of rules for
    re-opening businesses, schools, and more. I think, back in March, it
    still seemed possible that the American response could be more
    effective than Western Europe’s. But now, at least pending a second
    wave across the Atlantic, our response looks definitively worse. So
    we asked Jeneen to come back to talk about what went wrong, what, if
    anything, went right, and where we go from here. So Jeneen, welcome
    back to “The Argument” and congratulations, I guess, on being right
    about everything.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Ha\! Thank you for having me back, happy to be here. Not happy to be
    right about any of that stuff.

  - frank bruni  
    Hey, Jeneen, great to have you on the show.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    It’s great to be here.

  - ross douthat  
    So I, actually, was not here for that episode, mostly because I was
    ill with something that might have been COVID-19 myself. So can you
    just start by giving us a sketch of what’s happened between March
    and now and also how, if anything, have your views of the underlying
    situation changed?

  - jeneen interlandi  
    What I think happened is that we did not shut down sufficiently
    enough, we were too quick to reopen, and we didn’t employ any of the
    very basic measures that public health experts were calling for
    sufficiently enough to get things under control, and I think we’re
    still not doing that.

  - ross douthat  
    To the second part of my question, has anything changed in your
    assessment of the disease itself, in terms of its lethality, how it
    spreads, things like that?

  - jeneen interlandi  
    I did not expect that asymptomatic transmission was as much of a
    problem as it has turned out to be, so I think they’ve changed on
    that, definitely a lot of evolution in mine and everyone else’s
    thinking on mask-wearing. Not proud to admit that I think back then,
    I was certainly someone who was saying, the masks don’t protect you
    very much. They might stop you from transmitting it. But if you
    don’t think asymptomatic transmission is a problem, then why would
    you advocate mask-wearing? And given that we had such low supplies
    and hospitals were running out, my position in the beginning was
    very much like, save the actual masks for people who need them, for
    frontline workers. And you don’t actually need to go out and buy
    those and start hoarding them. So I definitely changed how I think
    about that.

  - frank bruni  
    Jeneen, Ross’s introduction made clear that you were prescient in
    some ways here. You thought that this would be with us for a while.
    You thought we were going to have to hunker down. I’m curious, what
    aspect of the country’s response to this has most surprised you, and
    what’s most infuriated you? And they may be the same thing.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    You know, one of the things that’s actually surprised me is how
    quickly Americans have gotten onboard with the idea of mask-wearing
    and even social distancing. We, in the media — and it’s for
    understandable reasons — make a lot of the anti-mask contingent and
    of all the pushback against basic sound public health advice. And I
    think sometimes we lose sight of the fact that recent surveys have
    shown 60 percent to 70 percent of Americans are totally onboard with
    mask-wearing, actually want stricter control measures in place, and
    still trust public health experts. And that’s really heartening, and
    it’s been surprising.

  - frank bruni  
    When you say that, I found myself wondering, do you feel that if our
    leaders could all get on the same page, show some consistency that
    Americans are actually ready to tackle this thing, but they lack the
    leadership?

  - jeneen interlandi  
    I think that consistent messaging is hugely, hugely important. The
    C.D.C. has a playbook for how to communicate during a pandemic or
    during any national health crisis. And one of the key principles is
    consistent messaging and consistent communication. Just because it’s
    a new era or a different era than the last time we had a global
    disease outbreak — we have the internet, we have social media —
    doesn’t mean that you throw that principle out the window. There’s
    so many people there that are on the fence, and they don’t know what
    information to believe. And so when you have lots of conflicting
    messages, not just out in the ether or off in cyberspace but coming
    from officials talking on national television, it makes it really
    hard for people to know what to do. And it gives anybody who’s
    skeptical and out to just kind of pick whatever advice best suits
    their mood or their opinion. And so when you have people speaking
    with one voice, I think you cut a lot of that noise out, and it
    makes it a lot easier for people to figure out what the right course
    of action is. And the fact that we have so much mixed messaging and
    the most confused we’ve gotten to 60 percent to 70 percent of
    mask-wearing, I feel like, imagine how much better we could do.

  - ross douthat  
    But there is also the problem, as you’ve just suggested, it’s hard
    to have a consistent message when your knowledge of the disease is,
    itself, is evolving.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Yeah, sure.

  - ross douthat  
    So we went from an initial period where public health authorities
    were focused on hand-to-hand surface transmission, where everybody
    was talking about washing their hands and terms like fomites were
    getting thrown around. And now, months in, we’re in a situation
    where airborne transmission seems much more important. And there was
    there was a period of time — it didn’t last incredibly long, but
    there was a period of time— when certain segments of the internet
    were more trustworthy about whether to use a mask than were official
    public health pronouncements. And it just seems like that’s a
    challenge that there’s no playbook to deal with, right? Your
    assessments evolve, and you have to change your statements. And then
    you look like you’re being inconsistent, and it’s hard to map out a
    way to avoid that in advance, except being maybe a little more
    cautious in how much you talk down mask wearing.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Yeah, I think so. But I also don’t think that the fog of war, as we
    refer to it, mentality — or just the idea that in the beginning of
    an outbreak, especially with a completely novel pathogen, the idea
    that we don’t know everything and we’re going to make missteps is
    inconsistent with the principle of communicating consistently,
    right? Part of consistent communication is being open and honest
    about what you don’t know. And then as you learn more, say, OK,
    turns out we were wrong about this. Here’s how we’re shifting
    course. That’s actually part of consistent and open communication,
    or that’s part of how you combat misinformation, is to be honest
    about what you don’t know and to correct for it as you go along. And
    you’re right. It also does mean a bit of humility and a bit of
    caution when you’re issuing guidelines.

  - frank bruni  
    Hey Jeneen, I want to ask you a question because I think there’s
    some difference of opinion between you and Ross that I’d like to get
    to, which is if you were writing the script for what this country
    does over the next four to six weeks, what would that script look
    like? And then I really want to hear Ross’s response to it.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    OK, so if I’m writing the script from scratch or just from the point
    that we’re at now, I think the first thing I want is much better
    data and much better use of data. So I want states and localities to
    make all of the information they have public. I want the C.D.C. to
    work aggressively with them to make that information useful. And
    then I want state and local officials, if not federal officials, to
    take that information, to take that data — and individual states and
    localities have done this. Harris County, Texas did a great job at
    this — basically creating a color-coded threat assessment that tells
    officials and citizens exactly what they need to do, based on how
    extensively the virus is spreading in their communities. So one of
    the things that people have argued a lot about is, you can’t have a
    nationwide lockdown. That doesn’t work because some places you have
    really bad outbreaks. In other places, you don’t have anything. And
    all you do is breed resentment in the communities that don’t have
    bad outbreaks, right? And then people don’t want to follow anything,
    and they get fatigued. Well, if you use data to actually create some
    sort of forecast or assessment of how the virus is actually
    spreading in given communities, it could be a nationwide kind of
    response system, but it’s employed locally. So I think that’s the
    first thing I would want to see. And then from there, the very next
    thing is to get that data as accurate as possible, you need much
    more testing. And so I want to see much more ramping up of testing.
    It’s kind of tiresome to even say that because we’ve been talking
    about this since March, but it’s still a huge problem. It still
    takes up to two weeks or longer to get test results back in some
    places. And that makes the testing itself almost pointless. If it
    takes that long to find out what the results are, why bother getting
    tested? So I want to see more of that, and I think there’s a lot the
    federal government could do that it’s not doing or it hasn’t done to
    improve the testing situation.

  - ross douthat  
    What could the federal government do more of on testing?

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Again, I feel weird saying these things because we’ve been seeing
    them for so long, but they remain true. We have the Defense
    Production Act for a reason. We also have provisions that allow for
    patent overrides, and we should be using those things. If not now,
    then when? Why do those things exist? They exist for exactly these
    situations. There are some companies that have developed rapid
    point-of-care tests that, from all of the sourcing I have, pretty
    accurate, really good tests could solve a lot of the problems. But
    the companies that develop those tests can’t make enough of them to
    deploy them across the country in a way that would be meaningful. So
    what the government need to do is step in and say, we’re going to
    take this patent because you don’t have the ability to produce it at
    the level that we need. We’re going to compensate you fairly for it,
    and then we’re going to task several companies across the country,
    under the Defense Production Act, with making this product at scale
    and getting it out as quickly as possible. Would that solve every
    problem tomorrow? No. Could you produce every test that you possibly
    need in the country in a week? No, but you should be trying to do
    those things. And if you did, we’d be in a much better place than we
    are right now.

  - ross douthat  
    There was an interview with Bill Gates a few days ago — I don’t know
    if you saw it— where he was very angry about many different things
    related to testing. But one point he made that he thought was
    interesting was that he’s arguing that these testing companies are
    getting paid large sums of money— public money, in many cases— for
    test results but not for timeliness of test results, right? And he
    was saying, basically, you should only reimburse companies that are
    delivering test results within 24 to 72 hours.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    That’s a fantastic idea. And other people have floated that to me,
    and I think it makes a lot of sense. You start tying reimbursement
    levels to how long it takes to get the testing results, and guess
    what? Companies are going to figure out how to get those results a
    lot faster.

  - ross douthat  
    So I want to go back to the first thing you said about lockdowns,
    right? You said we didn’t lock down well enough and long enough. And
    I think those are slightly separate things, so I want to ask you
    more about that. Do you think that the problem was our lockdowns
    just needed to go on an extra month in most states, and reopening
    should have been slower? Or do you think that we didn’t achieve the
    scale of lockdown, in terms of people not leaving their homes at
    all, that some countries in Western Europe at least attempted? Or do
    you think it’s both?

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Actually, both. I think it’s absolutely both of those things. The
    numbers I’ve seen are, like, if you look at a place where we had
    really good lockdown, it was essentially 50 percent, compared with I
    think it was 80 percent or 90 percent I saw of lockdown in countries
    where they’ve successfully not only flattened the curve, but
    actually turned it downward. So they had just much more stringent
    controls. And they had things like roadblocks, and you can’t leave a
    community. And if you do, they’re tracking if you’re going from one
    state to another. We didn’t have that here. We had people in New
    York fleeing, leaving, going to vacation homes. We had people going
    down to Florida. We had people traveling. We still had public
    transportation. And I think we needed to do a lot more in certain
    places than we did. And I recognize, absolutely, that that’s really
    tricky because every time you tighten the lockdown procedures, you
    hurt the economy that much more. But I would argue that by not doing
    that, the economy is suffering probably worse because it’s dragged
    out a lot longer than it might have had to otherwise.

  - ross douthat  
    I tend to agree that the initial lockdown could have been firmer in
    certain ways. But I think in terms of their length, we basically hit
    the plausible limit. And I think you could tell that we hit the
    plausible limit because of the kind of reactions that we started
    getting to it, both right-wing coded reactions like the anti mass
    protests, but also I think the surge of political protests around
    the George Floyd shooting were, in part, a reflection of social
    energy that had been tamped down and maybe wouldn’t have burst out
    in that particular way without that kind of provocation, but would
    have burst out in some way over the summer. I feel like you couldn’t
    run the lockdown for multiple months, especially, and this also goes
    back to the question of messaging, but the initial messaging was,
    we’re going to do this for a few weeks, and the goal is to flatten
    the curve, right? And there’s always been this conflict and this
    uncertainty, I think, in public messaging about whether the goal is
    flattening the curve and sort of extending the epidemic in a way
    that doesn’t overwhelm hospitals and gives us more time to get
    treatments and eventually gives us more time to get a vaccine,
    versus suppression, versus trying to actually stamp out the virus.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    But there’s a third thing there. It’s not just that. You’re not just
    flattening the curve. What you’re trying to do is get certain things
    in place so that you can manage the outbreaks more smartly, right?
    So if you do shutdown in a smart way, you’re supposed to be building
    up your testing capacity, your contact tracing capacity, your
    isolation and quarantine, which we never did enough of. You’re
    supposed to build those things up so that when you do reopen, you
    can actually monitor more effectively and keep flare-ups from
    becoming outbreaks all over again. We didn’t do any of those things.
    So Americans made huge sacrifices in abiding by the lockdowns to the
    extent that they did, and the federal government betrayed them by
    not using that time as effectively as it should have.

  - frank bruni  
    I got to tell you. As I listened to the two of you, I feel such a
    sense of surrender and failure. I hear both of you saying in
    different ways, we can’t really do aggressive lockdowns going
    forward because we just don’t have it in us. But it turned out, we
    kind of really didn’t have it in us, if we’re talking about the
    whole country, in those first months. And I’m haunted by this sense
    that all of this has revealed some fundamental shortcomings and
    flaws in the American character that are the principal explanation,
    along with failed political leadership, for our world-leading
    exceptional status and the number of infections and deaths.

  - ross douthat  
    So I would speak up for the American character a little bit. I think
    that yes, we did not have the scale of lockdown that some Western
    European countries had. I also think, though, that the scale that
    they had was, in some cases, effectively overly repressive. And you
    had cops chasing people out of parks in rural parts of England and
    things like that I think were never going to fly in the US. And
    also, the country really did shut down its entire economy — not for
    a week, but for several months, taking on its own set of significant
    costs of kids out of school and people dealing with depression and
    mental illness and all kinds of things. We really did do that. And
    we did, in fact, flatten the curve, right? I mean, that’s the odd
    thing about all this.

  - frank bruni  
    In some places and in some places only recently.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Yeah, and for really short periods of time. The piece I did for the
    magazine was on Harris County, Texas. They had aggressive
    stay-at-home orders. When Governor Abbott allowed the localities to
    kind of manage the response, Harris County was one place that really
    had pretty aggressive stay-at-home orders. And they had really
    consistent messaging, and they actually did flatten the curve and
    started to get a downturn. But what happens is none of the
    surrounding communities did the same thing. And eventually, Governor
    Abbott stepped in and said, no, you can’t do this. You can’t mandate
    masks. You can’t do X, Y, and Z. And then what you saw was they lost
    all of those gains that they had made, and I think that’s the story
    in a lot of places.

  - ross douthat  
    Well, but I guess I have a sort of twofold view of this, right? I
    think the central government completely failed. I think that
    President Trump obviously completely failed. I think there was an
    opportunity for substantial suppression that would have required
    major contact tracing. It would have required, as Jeneen says,
    testing to be not just ramped up — we did eventually ramp it up— but
    to ramp it up sooner and get results back faster. And we haven’t
    been able to achieve that. And it probably would have required more
    aggressive quarantine measures, state travel restrictions, like she
    said, people in COVID hotels earlier on. All of that we failed at,
    clearly.

  - frank bruni  
    Well, that’s what I’m saying, Ross.

  - ross douthat  
    What I’m saying, though, is that at the start of the epidemic, the
    public rhetoric was, the danger is that every part of the US is
    going to be like New York City ended up being, where you’re going to
    have a really, really high case fatality rate because hospitals are
    going to be overwhelmed, doctors aren’t going to be able to treat
    patients, and you’re going to end up with basically that soaring
    spike of deaths that you’ve got in New York City everywhere. And
    that has not happened, and it hasn’t happened in places like Texas
    and Florida and the Southwest that have had to new outbreaks. Those
    outbreaks have been bad, but they have looked like the curve on the
    initial charts that we had— not the spike, but the slower curve that
    rises and falls. And it’s a tragedy that we didn’t achieve more than
    that, but we also have not had a situation where everywhere has
    turned out like New York City, nothing close to that right now.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    So I would argue that at the outset, it wasn’t every place is going
    to be New York City. It was going to be, we’re going to have lots of
    different outbreaks. And basically what you’re talking about is a
    lot of this is preventable if we use just the basic public health
    measures that we have now. So we don’t have to wait for technology
    that doesn’t exist. If we do these things, we can save a lot of
    lives. And guess what? Most of those lives are going to be in
    low-income communities, communities of color, and really
    marginalized places where they don’t have good hospitals in their
    communities. So that’s the issue I would take with that.

  - frank bruni  
    All due respect, Ross, when I listen to you talk, I kind of don’t
    hear the full recognition that tens of thousands of Americans, who
    might not have had to die, died here.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Died, yeah.

  - frank bruni  
    I don’t think we can kind of get so deep in the weeds in but this,
    but that, but this is the way we are. I don’t think we can skate
    over that so easily. But I want to ask you a question that I want to
    get Jeneen’s response to. This is about America, how we’ve responded
    and kind of failed in a way other countries haven’t. This is about
    the American character. Ross, do you think we have found the right
    balance between famous American individualism and communal
    protection, communal concern?

  - ross douthat  
    No, I don’t. I think that we could have had more communal protection
    and more communal concern. But I do think lots and lots of people
    expected us to have not a New-York-level epidemic everywhere but
    multiple New Yorks, multiple versions of the mountain of deaths that
    Andrew Cuomo bizarrely put on a poster celebrating how New York
    handled things, and we have not had that. New York, and the
    Northeast generally, is a distinct and tragic curve, and the other
    curves, as bad as they’ve been, have not been that bad. And that is
    a testament, I think, to real public health achievements and real
    sacrifices that Americans made, even in the places that maybe
    reopened too early and so on. You still had social distancing. You
    still had mask-wearing. And the other thing I’m just trying to
    stress is that viruses are really unpredictable and hard to contain.
    And those challenges are real, and they don’t go away just by having
    better leadership in the White House than we’ve unfortunately had.
    And I guess the final thing— and here I am I’m really curious about
    Jeneen’s take — there are a lot of questions about where you
    actually reach herd immunity. And there’s a sort of lively debate
    about whether, at least with the kind of social distancing we still
    have in place, New York City might be at a de facto herd immunity,
    with around 20 percent or 25 percent of the country infected.

  - janeen interlandi  
    I don’t agree with that at all. I don’t agree with that.

  - ross douthat  
    OK, so tell me why that view is wrong.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Well, OK, so first of all, I think herd immunity is a little bit
    misunderstood as a concept, right? It’s the threshold at which
    enough people in a given population become immune to a virus that it
    can no longer cause huge outbreaks. But we normally calculate that
    based on a standardized intervention, like vaccination. When we talk
    about herd immunity as a scientific concept, we’re almost always
    talking about vaccination, how many people need to get vaccinated.
    That is not the same thing as herd immunity or as an ongoing,
    real-time infectious disease outbreak. So for the latter, it’s
    actually much tougher to say what the threshold would actually be.
    And you’re correct that some studies have cited 20 percent, but many
    more people seem to think it’s going to be closer to 60 percent, 70
    percent, 80 percent, right? So it’s going to be much higher than
    20%. And the bottom line really is that we just don’t know. So I
    think that’s one reason it’s kind of absurd to talk about herd
    immunity as a strategy. But realistically, most people don’t think
    it’s going to be 20 percent. They think it’s going to be
    significantly higher. So that’s the first thing that I would say
    about that.

  - ross douthat  
    I’m not advocating for it as a strategy.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    OK.

  - ross douthat  
    I’m arguing that we should observe it if it seems to be happening as
    a reality. Sweden was held up as the sort of control group for the
    virus early on, the country in the West that was doing the least to
    contain it. And the Swedish curve, without strong interventions,
    has, itself, bent down to the point where Sweden looks like a
    low-transmission US state at this point. And Sweden is a data point
    for the argument that you could get herd immunity at 20 percent or
    25 percent.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    I don’t think that they’ve actually done very well, right? They have
    higher infection rates than their neighboring countries. They have a
    pretty high mortality rate. I don’t think they’re anywhere near herd
    immunity. In fact, there was an open letter written by, I think, 20
    or 30 epidemiologists, including some from inside Sweden, saying
    they’re not even close to herd immunity. There’s still high
    susceptibility in the larger population, and their economy doesn’t
    appear to be doing much better than their neighbors’ economies for
    the strategy that they took.

  - ross douthat  
    I want to be clear on what I’m saying. I don’t think the Swedish
    strategy has contained the virus more effectively than their
    neighbors. It clearly has not.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    OK.

  - frank bruni  
    So what are you saying?

  - ross douthat  
    I’m saying that if you look at a chart right now of Sweden’s total
    cases and daily new cases and total deaths, the death line has
    flattened. The total case line has almost flattened. And daily new
    cases have done a big arc and now are very low. Sweden has death
    rates that are worse than Denmark and Norway that did severe
    lockdowns, but it’s death rates are not nearly as bad as some of the
    worst centers of the epidemic. That cries out for an explanation. So
    I’m just saying, I think there are a lot of data points right now
    that suggests that something maybe limits the virus’ spread at
    around that 25 percent threshold.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    I take you at your word at what the Swedish curve looks like right
    now. I don’t think that that in any way implies that the herd
    immunity threshold there or anywhere else is necessarily 20 percent.
    I think there’s about 5,000 different potential explanations for
    that. I don’t think it’s a leap from they’ve managed to bend the
    curve down to they have herd immunity. And I think also to your
    earlier point —

  - ross douthat  
    Well, I want to be clear, there is herd immunity for the level of
    social distancing we have now.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Yeah, herd immunity is not a fixed number.

  - ross douthat  
    Exactly.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Exactly, yeah. So that’s fine. But what I was arguing earlier, you
    want to make decisions about what things need to be closed down,
    what things can be reopened, how much social distancing you need,
    whether you want mask-wearing indoors, outdoors, everywhere based on
    what the case positivity rate is in a given area. Now, if you’re
    basing it on the data, then you’re doing it the right way. Whether
    you’re at a thing that you can reasonably define as herd immunity or
    not is kind of incidental. So I feel like you’re arguing for herd
    immunity as a strategy, even though I know you say you’re not. I’m
    just not sure how to understand that.

  - ross douthat  
    No, I think we agree.

  - frank bruni  
    \[LAUGHING\] I don’t know about that.

  - ross douthat  
    I think, in part, it’s a question about our level of optimism going
    forward and how bad we expect the disease to get in the fall. I
    think that we agree that you want basically a data-driven assessment
    of the disease’s prevalence in your community. And I agree, that’s
    more important than a theory of herd immunity that might be proven
    wrong.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Yeah, again, I don’t think we know the number for SARS-CoV-2 at all.
    I just don’t think it’s going to end up being near 20 percent, based
    on what I’ve seen. The other thing I would point out is in places
    like New York and I think in most of the Northeastern United States,
    studies have shown, the thing that they seem to have done right is
    to be much slower to open indoor dining and to open bars.

  - ross douthat  
    Yes. And I think New York City is particularly good at that, and I
    think that’s why things are much better in the Northeast than they
    are in other parts of the country. But again, that goes back to not
    throwing your hands up or saying, it’s great that we’re also
    libertarian here. It’s basically based on data. So based on data,
    we’re not going to open the bars and restaurants, and we’re going
    to be able to maybe open the schools in the fall. It’s a trade-off.
    Well, and that I guess can be our last question for you, which is,
    should the schools open in the fall?

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Again, I think it should be based on data. And I think if you do it
    based on the data and you say, OK, we have to have a certain
    positivity rate to safely open the schools, what you’re going to
    find quickly from there is, OK, how do we get to that positivity
    rate? Well, the first thing you have to do is think about whether
    you want to keep your indoor dining open, whether you want to keep
    your bars open. And then I think the conclusion is that you probably
    don’t.

  - ross douthat  
    But in practice, it seems like a lot of places have chosen indoor
    dining and bars over schools. And you also have a dynamic where you
    have certain states that maybe have a transmission spread rate that
    is low enough to reopen schools aren’t reopening them. This seems to
    be happening in the mid-Atlantic. And then states that have a higher
    transmission rate — Georgia, Texas, and so on — are opening them. So
    I think there is a wariness about just following the data in liberal
    states, as well as conservative states. And the sort of polarization
    that once Trump said, let’s open the schools, suddenly there was —

  - jeneen interlandi  
    “That’s a terrible idea\!”

  - ross douthat  
    — political pressure not to open them in places that could.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    You have these two kind of conflicting things in play at the same
    time. On one hand, it’s extreme fatigue on the part of everybody. I
    don’t care what your political persuasion is. You’re fatigued right
    now from all of the closures and just the abnormal existence we’ve
    had. And then on the other hand, if you have gains and you’ve
    managed to get to a place — if you live in Manhattan like I do —
    where you’re not hearing ambulances go down your street literally
    every five minutes and you’re terrified to even just go outside,
    you’re terrified of losing those gains. So you have this kind of
    terror and also this fatigue happening at the same time, and I think
    that’s part of where we’re at.

  - ross douthat  
    Well, I think terror and fatigue is a good place to close this
    discussion.

  - frank bruni  
    Jeneen, thank you so much.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Thanks, this was fun.

  - ross douthat  
    Jeneen, we’ll have you back at Christmas when we’ll all have herd
    immunity, and we’ll look forward to that.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Our holiday special, OK. Thanks, guys.

  - ross douthat  
    We’ll be right back.

  - frank bruni  
    Welcome back. We’re going to talk about American Catholicism, which,
    in an age of polarization, is a rare institution that sprawls across
    our political divide. It’s a church with a progressive-leaning pope
    and a conservative American hierarchy. It’s the church of Attorney
    General William Barr and of Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for
    president. It cuts across class. It cuts across ethnicity, which
    means that it’s uniquely cross-pressured. To talk about some of
    those pressures, we’ve invited our colleague Liz Bruenig. Liz,
    thanks so much for joining us on “The Argument” today.

  - liz bruenig  
    Thanks for having me on.

  - frank bruni  
    Liz, you recently wrote an op-ed about American Catholicism’s unease
    with the Black Lives Matter movement. “Racism Makes a Liar Out of
    God” was the terrific headline on your extremely interesting piece.
    Tell us about the argument you made.

  - liz bruenig  
    Well, thanks very much. I was interviewing Gloria Purvis, who’s a
    Black Catholic journalist, in a sense, and that she has run a
    broadcast radio show on EWTN, which is the largest Catholic media
    distributor in the world. She also had a television show. And one of
    EWTN’s local affiliates, the Guadalupe Radio Network in Texas, which
    is, I believe, one of their largest affiliates, if not the largest,
    dropped her show after the murder of George Floyd because she began
    to speak out quite vociferously about racism. And my response to
    that was just that it wasn’t particularly Catholic of them, that she
    wasn’t saying anything unorthodox, that everything she was saying is
    completely evinced and held up by church teaching. And so I just
    don’t think it should be that hard for Catholics to look at the
    claims being made, put aside various organizations, whether you like
    certain figureheads and so on and so forth, and just focus on the
    arguments emerging from this movement. And I think they’re pretty
    easy to endorse for a Catholic. I don’t see the hang-up.

  - frank bruni  
    So why, then, do you think she was dropped? How do you explain? Is
    that about racism? Is it about particular and peculiar discomfort
    with Black Lives Matter? What’s going on?

  - liz bruenig  
    I think it’s probably somewhat to do with particular discomfort with
    Black Lives Matter, and I think quite a lot of it has to do with the
    fact that having uncomfortable conversations doesn’t necessarily
    make for good radio. People don’t like to sit around and listen to
    people really hash out issues of life and death import — and she has
    co-hosts who sometimes have friendly disagreements with her —
    because that can be very distressing to hear, the same reason people
    don’t want to have those conversations interpersonally. And so I
    think it was a combination of that and widespread conservative
    mistrust of the Black Lives Global Network, this organization that
    has laid claim to the phrase “Black Lives Matter,” which, of course,
    preceded it.

  - frank bruni  
    One thing I wanted to ask you before we went on any further is when
    we’re talking about the Catholic Church, what are we really talking
    about, and how much meaning does that phrase have? And what I mean
    by that is I would probably be in a pollster’s box as a Catholic
    because I was raised in the Catholic Church, although I drifted far,
    far away. I believe you are a convert to Catholicism. Ross has his
    own relationship to Catholicism. So there are Catholics who care
    about what the pope says, and there are Catholics who never look in
    this direction. So what do we mean here by the Catholic Church?

  - liz bruenig  
    Well, it’s a global institution, and so every Catholic’s response to
    various world goings-on is going to be different. And I think when
    we we’re talking about the Catholic Church in this context, we refer
    to a number of things. The Catholic Church refers to, at times, the
    hierarchy, the church authorities. It, at times, refers to the
    laity, everyone who is baptized Catholic and receives the sacraments
    and is confirmed to the church. And then at times, it refers to the
    internal logic, the tradition, the rules of the Catholic Church. It
    takes all of those things to constitute it. So I think we’re always
    referring to a sort of mixture of things there.

  - ross douthat  
    In many ways, the church feels incredibly weak at this moment, and
    its sort of sprawl seems like part of its weakness, that it’s sort
    of been through a period of decline. It had the sex abuse crisis.
    It’s had this sort of internal argument over its own teachings,
    that, for my sins I’ve been involved in. And so things like the
    Black Lives Matter movement come along, and there is no Catholic
    authority figure or authority figures capable of saying, OK, we’re
    going to harness the church’s sprawl and spread to support this
    movement or to critique this movement or somewhere in between. And
    instead, you get this sort of very American, I guess,
    entrepreneurial thing where certain people appoint themselves a
    spokesman for Catholicism, and you have these particular clashes,
    like the one around Gloria Purvis. But there’s no sense of
    Catholicism as something that’s capable of coming together and
    playing a dynamic role at this moment. Although, but Liz, you sort
    of end your piece by suggesting that the bishops could do that to
    some extent?

  - liz bruenig  
    Well, the bishops could put the hierarchy behind the March for Black
    Life in Washington D.C., which is what the open letter calls for, is
    for the bishops to join that march. What the bishops can’t do it
    they can’t make anyone like it, and the church teaching already
    supports. So that’s two out of three. It’s not bad. But American
    Catholics — and at this point, Catholics all over the world,
    especially in North America and Europe — these are liberal subjects.
    So their approach to Catholicism is not the approach to Catholicism
    that someone alive during the counter-reformation would have taken.
    It’s an approach to Catholicism that’s informed by the general
    ideological atmosphere around here, which is I decide what sounds
    good to me, and I discard what doesn’t. And I am the sovereign of
    myself, and I operate within certain parameters. But very little is
    binding on me. And so you have some American Catholics who say, OK,
    if the hierarchy says we do it and it matches the church teaching,
    then we do it. It doesn’t really matter if it matches our other
    intuitions.

  - ross douthat  
    So let me push you a little bit on the dilemma here. I’m going to
    quote a not African-American, but African cardinal, Wilfrid Napier,
    who is from South Africa —

  - liz bruenig  
    That’s not the one I was expecting.

  - ross douthat  
    That’s not the one you’re expecting — who is, himself, Black. This
    is how the hierarchy of the church now manifests itself, in tweets.
    But he tweeted, Black Lives Matter creates real conflict of
    conscience. The mission statement of BLM-GNF — that’s the
    organization you were talking about earlier — advocates views on
    marriage and family that are totally repugnant to Catholic teaching,
    as are the actions of its activists. Yet there is an urgent need to
    expose all injustice against people of color. So this, I think,
    coming from outside the U.S., but it’s still, I think, distills the
    dilemma for Catholics who are maybe more sympathetic to the cause of
    criminal justice reform or police reform than some of the people who
    wanted Gloria Purvis’ show canceled, but I’d say the sort of current
    protest politics in its organizational and institutional forms and
    see a movement that is much more secular and left wing than was, for
    instance, the Civil Rights Movement at its peak, right? It’s not
    emerging out of the African-American church. Its rhetoric emerges
    out of an academic milieu that is, I think it’s fair to say, is
    pretty hostile to traditional Christianity and Catholicism. And as
    you just mentioned, in the penumbra of these riots, you get a lot of
    attacks on churches — not tons and tons, but there’s been a real
    uptick in vandalism of Catholic churches, some of it focused on
    figures like Saint Junipero Serra, who is a controversial figure for
    reasons related to the treatment of Native Americans under the
    mission system in California. But some of it is just sort of more
    all-purpose, right? Acts of vandalism that just knock the head off a
    statue of the Virgin Mary or something. And so it seems like there
    is actually some dilemma here where you’re trying to figure out, how
    do you lend your support to the cause of racial justice without
    ending up just as sort of a religious ally of a movement that is
    pretty hostile to Catholicism?

  - liz bruenig  
    I don’t think that the attacks on churches and statues have been
    anti-Catholic in particular. They tend to be people who are upset
    about, as you said, Spanish colonialism, the treatment of Native
    Americans under the Spanish colonial regime. So there have been
    attacks on missions. There have been attacks on statues of Saint
    Junipero Serra. With any protest, especially of this size, you’re
    going to get some delinquent sort of vandalism that has nothing to
    do with the protest at all. It’s just people doing things they
    cannot normally do and kind of having a libidinal moment there where
    they go a little crazy. I think quarantine has compounded this
    already-existing tendency. But I wouldn’t look at it as these people
    are anti-Catholic, they want the Catholic Church destroyed. That may
    well be in the case of some people. If you’re on the internet, you
    hear from those people every day.

  - ross douthat  
    I’ve never heard from those people. I don’t know what you mean.

  - liz bruenig  
    \[LAUGHS\] Yeah, who could they possibly be? We could probably
    rattle off some handles. But in reality, it seems like, you look at
    polling, the majority of Black people are Christians. And so it’s
    not the case that the Black people who are calling for an end to
    police violence are dead set on the destruction of the nuclear
    family or whatever. That might be the case with these activists who
    are writing the copy, but the Black Lives Matter Global Network is
    not a membership organization. You don’t have to pay dues and if you
    don’t pay your dues, you can’t show up to the protest. The
    organizing efforts against anti-racism don’t require you to
    participate in whatever efforts there are or may be to destroy
    statues or undermine the church. On the other hand, the church is
    pretty good at undermining itself, so it doesn’t really need any
    help.

  - frank bruni  
    So when someone like Andrew Sullivan, whom you mentioned in your
    column, says Black Lives Matter and Catholicism are incompatible, is
    he kind of focusing on a detail that is less meaningful than he’s
    making it out to be?

  - liz bruenig  
    I think his complaint was that the Black Lives Matter Global Network
    is Marxist and that you can’t be a Marxist and a Catholic. You can,
    actually. I have this on good authority.

  - ross douthat  
    In a very complicated sort of way.

  - liz bruenig  
    \[LAUGHS\] Marxism can be said in many ways, as I imagine Aquinas
    would have put it. And so I tend to think that people like Andrew
    would probably not be in favor of this movement in any universe,
    right? And so the Catholicism issue is an opportunity to make a
    shell argument that’s not substantive. It’s about something else.
    It’s a procedural objection. Oh, well, I would, but I have all
    these other things that I have to subscribe to ahead of this, so I
    can’t.

  - ross douthat  
    Well, OK, but people are not wrong to look at the current moment of
    protest and say, well, this seems to be about not just racism and
    police brutality, but also a kind of substantial reordering of elite
    American institutions, for instance, in ways that are sort of much
    more secular and left wing than movements that the Catholic Church
    usually associates itself with and more hostile to not just Catholic
    beliefs on one particular issue, but the wider panoply of beliefs,
    right?

  - liz bruenig  
    Right. No, I think that’s true. I think that no institution coming
    out of American soil shares the aims of the Catholic Church. These
    are all liberal institutions. Their aims are circumscribed by the
    event horizon of temporality, right? So this is to say, the goals of
    all of the institutions that come out of American thought and
    American life, these are liberal institutions that have goals that
    are sort of utilitarian, or they have to do with sort of freedom and
    equality. And those are aspects of Catholic teaching. They’re
    certainly not the end goal of Catholic teaching. So then the
    question is, how distant is this particular movement from Catholic
    Church teaching, and how distant can a movement be before we have to
    completely abandon it? And I would say that all that’s required is a
    little of that good old discernment that we hear about so often,
    especially from our Jesuit friends, which would be paying attention
    to what aspects of the movement are being foregrounded and in what
    way you’re being asked to support it. So if there is, say, a
    referendum in your city on police funding or the ways in which
    police can or should try to de-escalate, as opposed to defaulting to
    violence, or body cams or something like that, you can go ahead and
    think, what is the best way to cast a vote here that is going to
    hopefully create a more equitable landscape in this city for the
    people who live here with me? You don’t have to affirm in the
    strongest terms even the entirety of the movement. But to the degree
    that you have power as a citizen, I think it’s probably pretty easy
    to exercise that in a way that comports with any racist goals.

  - frank bruni  
    Liz, what do you make of Trump’s attacks on Biden’s Catholicism or
    on Biden’s religion, which is thus implicitly Catholicism? And do
    you think Biden’s Catholicism factors into, colors this coming
    election in any interesting ways?

  - liz bruenig  
    Trump is an interesting figure in that he sort of doesn’t even
    really put up the bare pretense of being all that interested in
    religion.

  - frank bruni  
    \[LAUGHING\] He does hold a Bible upside down very photogenically.

  - liz bruenig  
    Right, he’ll do stuff like that, which is vaguely insulting, and go
    stand out in front of a church. And the tone of that is always like,
    you piggies sure love this slop, don’t you? Lap it up. \[BRUNI
    LAUGHS\] And it’s a little insulting. I don’t like it when any
    politicians talk about their religion. I’ve never heard one of them
    do it in a way that was remotely convincing, and Trump, in
    particular, just doesn’t even really bother with it, which I kind of
    grudgingly respect because it’s so clearly a charade. The ones that
    try to be earnest about it are, in some ways, a little more
    disturbing to me. But he has no room to attack Joe Biden’s
    Catholicism, the nature of which I know nothing about. And to the
    degree that it will even matter at all in the election, which I
    doubt it will, it could be good for Biden. Catholics are classic
    swing voters. There are lots of Catholics in swing states. Catholics
    typically split right down the middle, 50-50, Republican-Democrat.
    And if he can pull any Catholics who wouldn’t have otherwise given
    him a shot because he is Catholic, that’s possible, and that’s
    interesting, I suppose. But my feeling is that American Catholicism
    has been so thoroughly Protestantized that it doesn’t really matter.
    And moreover, very few Protestants could tell you in what ways
    Catholics are morally different than they are in the United States,
    right? So back in the day, you would have been called a crypto
    Catholic if you said something like, well, whether or not you go to
    heaven depends a lot on you. But this is also just sort of common
    American Protestant thought at this point. It’s rather unusual to
    find very vocal Calvinists. And so because the lines between
    Catholicism and Protestantism the United States are sort of blurred
    at this point— the evangelicalized Catholics on the right and then
    the sort of liberalized Protestants who have kind of lost a lot of
    those puritanical elements of Protestantism on the left— I just
    don’t really think it matters. It’s definitely not going to be a
    JFK-type situation.

  - frank bruni  
    Well, and what you’re saying makes me think that’s one of the
    reasons why Trump instinctively attacked Biden’s religion in the
    larger sense and not necessarily his Catholicism because I think he,
    at some level, understands what you just said, which is that people
    don’t necessarily see these bold lines where they once saw them
    between Protestantism and Catholicism.

  - ross douthat  
    Trump is going for the idea, which is a true idea that among white
    Americans, there is a real pew gap between the parties, in the sense
    that Republicans are more likely to be church-goers, and Democrats
    are not. And there is an odd reversal of that in the actual leaders
    of the parties, in that Trump is not a church-goer and Joe Biden is.
    So Trump, in his way, is sort of going right at that and saying, oh,
    you think Biden’s a church-goer, well, he’s against God, right? I
    mean, that’s sort of the classic Trump.

  - frank bruni  
    What does that even mean, Ross?

  - ross douthat  
    Well, I may not go to church, but he’s against God.

  - frank bruni  
    What does that even mean when he said he’s against God? What does
    that even mean?

  - ross douthat  
    Well, it’s like when Trump was asked, back when he was first trying
    to figure out how to talk like a pro-lifer, and he said something
    about how, well, we really need to punish women who have abortions,
    which is not and has never been the main pro-life position on the
    issue. But to Trump, it seemed like something that he imagined a
    pro-life person would say. And I think you get some of that in the
    against god rhetoric, too.

  - liz bruenig  
    Yeah, Trump was just doing logic in that case.

  - frank bruni  
    \[LAUGHING\] Wait, wait, wait, wait, Liz, did you really just use
    Trump and logic in the same phrase?

  - liz bruenig  
    I’m not kidding. He was sitting there. He knows nothing about
    Christianity in America. He knows nothing about the pro-life
    movement. He’s not remotely interested in any of these issues. And
    so someone asks him, do you think that women who have abortions
    should be punished? So he has to come up with an answer on the spot
    because he has no relationship to this movement. And he’s like,
    well, yeah, I mean, I guess. They say it’s murder so yeah. \[BRUNI
    LAUGHS\] And that’s like very basic \[LAUGHS\] logic he was
    performing there. And again, he did the same thing with Biden where
    he’s like, well, damn, if you’re not with him, you’re against him.
    So the question is, are the people that Biden is competing for with
    Trump — the swing people that Biden needs to grab — are they really
    interested in hearing a bunch of legitimate-sounding Christian
    rhetoric, or are these people who are interested in something else?
    And will the swing vote come down to that? I am not actually
    convinced that religion will play that big of a role in the swing
    vote.

  - ross douthat  
    I think Trump would have been better served just attacking Biden on
    the issue of abortion, where Biden actually used to be closer to the
    center and has moved more to the left in his campaign, and just made
    it an issues-based appeal because I think there are a lot of
    Americans who are conflicted about abortion who are swing voters.
    
    Put it this way — I think the swing voters, Liz, think the basic
    idea of Joe Biden as a guy who goes to mass on Sunday and doesn’t
    always agree with his church, that’s them, too, right? So saying
    that those kind of people are somehow against God, it’s just an
    attempt to mobilize people already voting for Trump, not to win over
    the undecided.

  - frank bruni  
    We have to let Liz go in a moment. But before we go, Liz, I
    understand you may have a recommendation for our listeners.

  - liz bruenig  
    So I would recommend logging off, which is not to say not using your
    computer or whatever. That’s just a tool. But get off social media.
    You know what I mean. I think most of the people who say log off
    point to the fact that there’s so much misinformation and lying on
    the internet that it can really cloud your judgment, and that’s
    true. But worse is that there is so much true information on the
    internet. And I don’t think we’re actually particularly
    well-designed to cope with getting news of the entire world updated
    every 10 minutes on a live stream. I think it’s extremely stressful.
    It’s too much true information. And I think that it can lead to a
    real sort of spiritual darkness. It used to be the sole province of
    God to know a full accounting of all the human evil that was
    happening at any given time. Now it’s the province of any Twitter
    user, and it’s a heavy burden. So log off. I close Twitter for six
    hours a day at a time and have nothing to do with it, and I’m much
    happier knowing less.

  - frank bruni  
    Thank you for that, Liz, and thank you so much for coming on the
    show.

  - ross douthat  
    Yes, thank you, Liz.

  - liz bruenig  
    Thanks so much for having me, guys.

  - frank bruni  
    I’m Frank Bruni.

  - ross douthat  
    I’m Ross Douthat, and this is “The Argument.” \[THEME MUSIC PLAYS\]
    
    Today, a conversation about where we stand with COVID-19. Can the
    U.S. still contain its spread, or are we already defeated? Then
    nearly 1/5 of all Americans identify as Catholic, but can their
    church say “Black Lives Matter“?
    
    Frank, welcome back.

  - frank bruni  
    Hey, Ross.

  - ross douthat  
    So I think our listeners may be especially glad to hear your voice,
    after last week’s all-conservative spectacular, \[BRUNI LAUGHS\] in
    which I was the moderate squish, arguing with more pro-Trump
    conservatives. Did you give it a listen?

  - frank bruni  
    I did, and all-conservative spectacular was not the phrase that came
    immediately to mind. It was an interesting experience, Ross.

  - ross douthat  
    That’s all I can ask, Frank.

  - frank bruni  
    I wanted to be there. I wished I could have inserted myself ever so
    briefly, just to kind of ask your guests, who seemed to think Trump
    had done a good job managing the pandemic, what they make of our
    world-leading case counts and death totals and how they explain
    that. But seriously though, I agreed with many listeners who wrote
    in and said that it was a discussion they wouldn’t normally get to
    hear. It’s the kind of thing that they hoped to hear when they
    turned to our show, something that hadn’t crossed their radar before
    and they might not have thought of. And if it’s OK, Ross, I want to
    read what one reader named Donna wrote in because I thought it was
    very interesting. She says, “I found the latest right-wing coup
    episode one of your best ever. I like to hear both sides of an
    argument. Your show provides that, to an extent. But Ross often
    seems outnumbered and ganged up on by Michelle and Frank. I would
    like to know more about far-right views, but it’s difficult for me
    to listen to Fox News opinion segments or AM talk radio for all the
    interruptions, over-speaking, and name-calling.” So that’s a pretty
    great endorsement, Ross.

  - ross douthat  
    There’s very little name-calling on our show, and we’re proud of it.

  - frank bruni  
    No, you and I only call each other names after we turn off the
    microphones.

  - ross douthat  
    Yeah, or our producers—

  - frank bruni  
    I’m kidding. I’m kidding.

  - ross douthat  
    —call both of us terrible names.

  - frank bruni  
    Well, that’s for sure, yeah.

  - ross douthat  
    Well, I appreciate Donna’s take. I know not every listener probably
    had the same take, and I suspect Michelle herself probably had a
    slightly different one. But she’s off this week, and I will be
    suspiciously and conveniently on vacation next week. So it’ll be a
    little while before I get to hear her take. Anyway, let’s get to
    this week’s episode. For our first segment, we’re joined by Jeneen
    Interlandi, who writes about health and science for opinions
    editorial board and for The New York Times Magazine. Listeners may
    remember her voice from way back in March when we were wondering if
    quarantine would last through the end of that month. Back then,
    Jeneen told us to hunker down. She said the virus wasn’t likely to
    go anywhere through at least the end of the year. And at the time,
    that seemed — well, for a lot of people — tough to imagine. And yet,
    here we are, still in limbo, waiting on a vaccine with more than 5
    million cases since March, more than 162,000 dead, the federal
    government gridlocked, and a state-by-state patchwork of rules for
    re-opening businesses, schools, and more. I think, back in March, it
    still seemed possible that the American response could be more
    effective than Western Europe’s. But now, at least pending a second
    wave across the Atlantic, our response looks definitively worse. So
    we asked Jeneen to come back to talk about what went wrong, what, if
    anything, went right, and where we go from here. So Jeneen, welcome
    back to “The Argument” and congratulations, I guess, on being right
    about everything.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Ha\! Thank you for having me back, happy to be here. Not happy to be
    right about any of that stuff.

  - frank bruni  
    Hey, Jeneen, great to have you on the show.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    It’s great to be here.

  - ross douthat  
    So I, actually, was not here for that episode, mostly because I was
    ill with something that might have been COVID-19 myself. So can you
    just start by giving us a sketch of what’s happened between March
    and now and also how, if anything, have your views of the underlying
    situation changed?

  - jeneen interlandi  
    What I think happened is that we did not shut down sufficiently
    enough, we were too quick to reopen, and we didn’t employ any of the
    very basic measures that public health experts were calling for
    sufficiently enough to get things under control, and I think we’re
    still not doing that.

  - ross douthat  
    To the second part of my question, has anything changed in your
    assessment of the disease itself, in terms of its lethality, how it
    spreads, things like that?

  - jeneen interlandi  
    I did not expect that asymptomatic transmission was as much of a
    problem as it has turned out to be, so I think they’ve changed on
    that, definitely a lot of evolution in mine and everyone else’s
    thinking on mask-wearing. Not proud to admit that I think back then,
    I was certainly someone who was saying, the masks don’t protect you
    very much. They might stop you from transmitting it. But if you
    don’t think asymptomatic transmission is a problem, then why would
    you advocate mask-wearing? And given that we had such low supplies
    and hospitals were running out, my position in the beginning was
    very much like, save the actual masks for people who need them, for
    frontline workers. And you don’t actually need to go out and buy
    those and start hoarding them. So I definitely changed how I think
    about that.

  - frank bruni  
    Jeneen, Ross’s introduction made clear that you were prescient in
    some ways here. You thought that this would be with us for a while.
    You thought we were going to have to hunker down. I’m curious, what
    aspect of the country’s response to this has most surprised you, and
    what’s most infuriated you? And they may be the same thing.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    You know, one of the things that’s actually surprised me is how
    quickly Americans have gotten onboard with the idea of mask-wearing
    and even social distancing. We, in the media — and it’s for
    understandable reasons — make a lot of the anti-mask contingent and
    of all the pushback against basic sound public health advice. And I
    think sometimes we lose sight of the fact that recent surveys have
    shown 60 percent to 70 percent of Americans are totally onboard with
    mask-wearing, actually want stricter control measures in place, and
    still trust public health experts. And that’s really heartening, and
    it’s been surprising.

  - frank bruni  
    When you say that, I found myself wondering, do you feel that if our
    leaders could all get on the same page, show some consistency that
    Americans are actually ready to tackle this thing, but they lack the
    leadership?

  - jeneen interlandi  
    I think that consistent messaging is hugely, hugely important. The
    C.D.C. has a playbook for how to communicate during a pandemic or
    during any national health crisis. And one of the key principles is
    consistent messaging and consistent communication. Just because it’s
    a new era or a different era than the last time we had a global
    disease outbreak — we have the internet, we have social media —
    doesn’t mean that you throw that principle out the window. There’s
    so many people there that are on the fence, and they don’t know what
    information to believe. And so when you have lots of conflicting
    messages, not just out in the ether or off in cyberspace but coming
    from officials talking on national television, it makes it really
    hard for people to know what to do. And it gives anybody who’s
    skeptical and out to just kind of pick whatever advice best suits
    their mood or their opinion. And so when you have people speaking
    with one voice, I think you cut a lot of that noise out, and it
    makes it a lot easier for people to figure out what the right course
    of action is. And the fact that we have so much mixed messaging and
    the most confused we’ve gotten to 60 percent to 70 percent of
    mask-wearing, I feel like, imagine how much better we could do.

  - ross douthat  
    But there is also the problem, as you’ve just suggested, it’s hard
    to have a consistent message when your knowledge of the disease is,
    itself, is evolving.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Yeah, sure.

  - ross douthat  
    So we went from an initial period where public health authorities
    were focused on hand-to-hand surface transmission, where everybody
    was talking about washing their hands and terms like fomites were
    getting thrown around. And now, months in, we’re in a situation
    where airborne transmission seems much more important. And there was
    there was a period of time — it didn’t last incredibly long, but
    there was a period of time— when certain segments of the internet
    were more trustworthy about whether to use a mask than were official
    public health pronouncements. And it just seems like that’s a
    challenge that there’s no playbook to deal with, right? Your
    assessments evolve, and you have to change your statements. And then
    you look like you’re being inconsistent, and it’s hard to map out a
    way to avoid that in advance, except being maybe a little more
    cautious in how much you talk down mask wearing.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Yeah, I think so. But I also don’t think that the fog of war, as we
    refer to it, mentality — or just the idea that in the beginning of
    an outbreak, especially with a completely novel pathogen, the idea
    that we don’t know everything and we’re going to make missteps is
    inconsistent with the principle of communicating consistently,
    right? Part of consistent communication is being open and honest
    about what you don’t know. And then as you learn more, say, OK,
    turns out we were wrong about this. Here’s how we’re shifting
    course. That’s actually part of consistent and open communication,
    or that’s part of how you combat misinformation, is to be honest
    about what you don’t know and to correct for it as you go along. And
    you’re right. It also does mean a bit of humility and a bit of
    caution when you’re issuing guidelines.

  - frank bruni  
    Hey Jeneen, I want to ask you a question because I think there’s
    some difference of opinion between you and Ross that I’d like to get
    to, which is if you were writing the script for what this country
    does over the next four to six weeks, what would that script look
    like? And then I really want to hear Ross’s response to it.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    OK, so if I’m writing the script from scratch or just from the point
    that we’re at now, I think the first thing I want is much better
    data and much better use of data. So I want states and localities to
    make all of the information they have public. I want the C.D.C. to
    work aggressively with them to make that information useful. And
    then I want state and local officials, if not federal officials, to
    take that information, to take that data — and individual states and
    localities have done this. Harris County, Texas did a great job at
    this — basically creating a color-coded threat assessment that tells
    officials and citizens exactly what they need to do, based on how
    extensively the virus is spreading in their communities. So one of
    the things that people have argued a lot about is, you can’t have a
    nationwide lockdown. That doesn’t work because some places you have
    really bad outbreaks. In other places, you don’t have anything. And
    all you do is breed resentment in the communities that don’t have
    bad outbreaks, right? And then people don’t want to follow anything,
    and they get fatigued. Well, if you use data to actually create some
    sort of forecast or assessment of how the virus is actually
    spreading in given communities, it could be a nationwide kind of
    response system, but it’s employed locally. So I think that’s the
    first thing I would want to see. And then from there, the very next
    thing is to get that data as accurate as possible, you need much
    more testing. And so I want to see much more ramping up of testing.
    It’s kind of tiresome to even say that because we’ve been talking
    about this since March, but it’s still a huge problem. It still
    takes up to two weeks or longer to get test results back in some
    places. And that makes the testing itself almost pointless. If it
    takes that long to find out what the results are, why bother getting
    tested? So I want to see more of that, and I think there’s a lot the
    federal government could do that it’s not doing or it hasn’t done to
    improve the testing situation.

  - ross douthat  
    What could the federal government do more of on testing?

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Again, I feel weird saying these things because we’ve been seeing
    them for so long, but they remain true. We have the Defense
    Production Act for a reason. We also have provisions that allow for
    patent overrides, and we should be using those things. If not now,
    then when? Why do those things exist? They exist for exactly these
    situations. There are some companies that have developed rapid
    point-of-care tests that, from all of the sourcing I have, pretty
    accurate, really good tests could solve a lot of the problems. But
    the companies that develop those tests can’t make enough of them to
    deploy them across the country in a way that would be meaningful. So
    what the government need to do is step in and say, we’re going to
    take this patent because you don’t have the ability to produce it at
    the level that we need. We’re going to compensate you fairly for it,
    and then we’re going to task several companies across the country,
    under the Defense Production Act, with making this product at scale
    and getting it out as quickly as possible. Would that solve every
    problem tomorrow? No. Could you produce every test that you possibly
    need in the country in a week? No, but you should be trying to do
    those things. And if you did, we’d be in a much better place than we
    are right now.

  - ross douthat  
    There was an interview with Bill Gates a few days ago — I don’t know
    if you saw it— where he was very angry about many different things
    related to testing. But one point he made that he thought was
    interesting was that he’s arguing that these testing companies are
    getting paid large sums of money— public money, in many cases— for
    test results but not for timeliness of test results, right? And he
    was saying, basically, you should only reimburse companies that are
    delivering test results within 24 to 72 hours.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    That’s a fantastic idea. And other people have floated that to me,
    and I think it makes a lot of sense. You start tying reimbursement
    levels to how long it takes to get the testing results, and guess
    what? Companies are going to figure out how to get those results a
    lot faster.

  - ross douthat  
    So I want to go back to the first thing you said about lockdowns,
    right? You said we didn’t lock down well enough and long enough. And
    I think those are slightly separate things, so I want to ask you
    more about that. Do you think that the problem was our lockdowns
    just needed to go on an extra month in most states, and reopening
    should have been slower? Or do you think that we didn’t achieve the
    scale of lockdown, in terms of people not leaving their homes at
    all, that some countries in Western Europe at least attempted? Or do
    you think it’s both?

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Actually, both. I think it’s absolutely both of those things. The
    numbers I’ve seen are, like, if you look at a place where we had
    really good lockdown, it was essentially 50 percent, compared with I
    think it was 80 percent or 90 percent I saw of lockdown in countries
    where they’ve successfully not only flattened the curve, but
    actually turned it downward. So they had just much more stringent
    controls. And they had things like roadblocks, and you can’t leave a
    community. And if you do, they’re tracking if you’re going from one
    state to another. We didn’t have that here. We had people in New
    York fleeing, leaving, going to vacation homes. We had people going
    down to Florida. We had people traveling. We still had public
    transportation. And I think we needed to do a lot more in certain
    places than we did. And I recognize, absolutely, that that’s really
    tricky because every time you tighten the lockdown procedures, you
    hurt the economy that much more. But I would argue that by not doing
    that, the economy is suffering probably worse because it’s dragged
    out a lot longer than it might have had to otherwise.

  - ross douthat  
    I tend to agree that the initial lockdown could have been firmer in
    certain ways. But I think in terms of their length, we basically hit
    the plausible limit. And I think you could tell that we hit the
    plausible limit because of the kind of reactions that we started
    getting to it, both right-wing coded reactions like the anti mass
    protests, but also I think the surge of political protests around
    the George Floyd shooting were, in part, a reflection of social
    energy that had been tamped down and maybe wouldn’t have burst out
    in that particular way without that kind of provocation, but would
    have burst out in some way over the summer. I feel like you couldn’t
    run the lockdown for multiple months, especially, and this also goes
    back to the question of messaging, but the initial messaging was,
    we’re going to do this for a few weeks, and the goal is to flatten
    the curve, right? And there’s always been this conflict and this
    uncertainty, I think, in public messaging about whether the goal is
    flattening the curve and sort of extending the epidemic in a way
    that doesn’t overwhelm hospitals and gives us more time to get
    treatments and eventually gives us more time to get a vaccine,
    versus suppression, versus trying to actually stamp out the virus.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    But there’s a third thing there. It’s not just that. You’re not just
    flattening the curve. What you’re trying to do is get certain things
    in place so that you can manage the outbreaks more smartly, right?
    So if you do shutdown in a smart way, you’re supposed to be building
    up your testing capacity, your contact tracing capacity, your
    isolation and quarantine, which we never did enough of. You’re
    supposed to build those things up so that when you do reopen, you
    can actually monitor more effectively and keep flare-ups from
    becoming outbreaks all over again. We didn’t do any of those things.
    So Americans made huge sacrifices in abiding by the lockdowns to the
    extent that they did, and the federal government betrayed them by
    not using that time as effectively as it should have.

  - frank bruni  
    I got to tell you. As I listened to the two of you, I feel such a
    sense of surrender and failure. I hear both of you saying in
    different ways, we can’t really do aggressive lockdowns going
    forward because we just don’t have it in us. But it turned out, we
    kind of really didn’t have it in us, if we’re talking about the
    whole country, in those first months. And I’m haunted by this sense
    that all of this has revealed some fundamental shortcomings and
    flaws in the American character that are the principal explanation,
    along with failed political leadership, for our world-leading
    exceptional status and the number of infections and deaths.

  - ross douthat  
    So I would speak up for the American character a little bit. I think
    that yes, we did not have the scale of lockdown that some Western
    European countries had. I also think, though, that the scale that
    they had was, in some cases, effectively overly repressive. And you
    had cops chasing people out of parks in rural parts of England and
    things like that I think were never going to fly in the US. And
    also, the country really did shut down its entire economy — not for
    a week, but for several months, taking on its own set of significant
    costs of kids out of school and people dealing with depression and
    mental illness and all kinds of things. We really did do that. And
    we did, in fact, flatten the curve, right? I mean, that’s the odd
    thing about all this.

  - frank bruni  
    In some places and in some places only recently.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Yeah, and for really short periods of time. The piece I did for the
    magazine was on Harris County, Texas. They had aggressive
    stay-at-home orders. When Governor Abbott allowed the localities to
    kind of manage the response, Harris County was one place that really
    had pretty aggressive stay-at-home orders. And they had really
    consistent messaging, and they actually did flatten the curve and
    started to get a downturn. But what happens is none of the
    surrounding communities did the same thing. And eventually, Governor
    Abbott stepped in and said, no, you can’t do this. You can’t mandate
    masks. You can’t do X, Y, and Z. And then what you saw was they lost
    all of those gains that they had made, and I think that’s the story
    in a lot of places.

  - ross douthat  
    Well, but I guess I have a sort of twofold view of this, right? I
    think the central government completely failed. I think that
    President Trump obviously completely failed. I think there was an
    opportunity for substantial suppression that would have required
    major contact tracing. It would have required, as Jeneen says,
    testing to be not just ramped up — we did eventually ramp it up— but
    to ramp it up sooner and get results back faster. And we haven’t
    been able to achieve that. And it probably would have required more
    aggressive quarantine measures, state travel restrictions, like she
    said, people in COVID hotels earlier on. All of that we failed at,
    clearly.

  - frank bruni  
    Well, that’s what I’m saying, Ross.

  - ross douthat  
    What I’m saying, though, is that at the start of the epidemic, the
    public rhetoric was, the danger is that every part of the US is
    going to be like New York City ended up being, where you’re going to
    have a really, really high case fatality rate because hospitals are
    going to be overwhelmed, doctors aren’t going to be able to treat
    patients, and you’re going to end up with basically that soaring
    spike of deaths that you’ve got in New York City everywhere. And
    that has not happened, and it hasn’t happened in places like Texas
    and Florida and the Southwest that have had to new outbreaks. Those
    outbreaks have been bad, but they have looked like the curve on the
    initial charts that we had— not the spike, but the slower curve that
    rises and falls. And it’s a tragedy that we didn’t achieve more than
    that, but we also have not had a situation where everywhere has
    turned out like New York City, nothing close to that right now.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    So I would argue that at the outset, it wasn’t every place is going
    to be New York City. It was going to be, we’re going to have lots of
    different outbreaks. And basically what you’re talking about is a
    lot of this is preventable if we use just the basic public health
    measures that we have now. So we don’t have to wait for technology
    that doesn’t exist. If we do these things, we can save a lot of
    lives. And guess what? Most of those lives are going to be in
    low-income communities, communities of color, and really
    marginalized places where they don’t have good hospitals in their
    communities. So that’s the issue I would take with that.

  - frank bruni  
    All due respect, Ross, when I listen to you talk, I kind of don’t
    hear the full recognition that tens of thousands of Americans, who
    might not have had to die, died here.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Died, yeah.

  - frank bruni  
    I don’t think we can kind of get so deep in the weeds in but this,
    but that, but this is the way we are. I don’t think we can skate
    over that so easily. But I want to ask you a question that I want to
    get Jeneen’s response to. This is about America, how we’ve responded
    and kind of failed in a way other countries haven’t. This is about
    the American character. Ross, do you think we have found the right
    balance between famous American individualism and communal
    protection, communal concern?

  - ross douthat  
    No, I don’t. I think that we could have had more communal protection
    and more communal concern. But I do think lots and lots of people
    expected us to have not a New-York-level epidemic everywhere but
    multiple New Yorks, multiple versions of the mountain of deaths that
    Andrew Cuomo bizarrely put on a poster celebrating how New York
    handled things, and we have not had that. New York, and the
    Northeast generally, is a distinct and tragic curve, and the other
    curves, as bad as they’ve been, have not been that bad. And that is
    a testament, I think, to real public health achievements and real
    sacrifices that Americans made, even in the places that maybe
    reopened too early and so on. You still had social distancing. You
    still had mask-wearing. And the other thing I’m just trying to
    stress is that viruses are really unpredictable and hard to contain.
    And those challenges are real, and they don’t go away just by having
    better leadership in the White House than we’ve unfortunately had.
    And I guess the final thing— and here I am I’m really curious about
    Jeneen’s take — there are a lot of questions about where you
    actually reach herd immunity. And there’s a sort of lively debate
    about whether, at least with the kind of social distancing we still
    have in place, New York City might be at a de facto herd immunity,
    with around 20 percent or 25 percent of the country infected.

  - janeen interlandi  
    I don’t agree with that at all. I don’t agree with that.

  - ross douthat  
    OK, so tell me why that view is wrong.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Well, OK, so first of all, I think herd immunity is a little bit
    misunderstood as a concept, right? It’s the threshold at which
    enough people in a given population become immune to a virus that it
    can no longer cause huge outbreaks. But we normally calculate that
    based on a standardized intervention, like vaccination. When we talk
    about herd immunity as a scientific concept, we’re almost always
    talking about vaccination, how many people need to get vaccinated.
    That is not the same thing as herd immunity or as an ongoing,
    real-time infectious disease outbreak. So for the latter, it’s
    actually much tougher to say what the threshold would actually be.
    And you’re correct that some studies have cited 20 percent, but many
    more people seem to think it’s going to be closer to 60 percent, 70
    percent, 80 percent, right? So it’s going to be much higher than
    20%. And the bottom line really is that we just don’t know. So I
    think that’s one reason it’s kind of absurd to talk about herd
    immunity as a strategy. But realistically, most people don’t think
    it’s going to be 20 percent. They think it’s going to be
    significantly higher. So that’s the first thing that I would say
    about that.

  - ross douthat  
    I’m not advocating for it as a strategy.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    OK.

  - ross douthat  
    I’m arguing that we should observe it if it seems to be happening as
    a reality. Sweden was held up as the sort of control group for the
    virus early on, the country in the West that was doing the least to
    contain it. And the Swedish curve, without strong interventions,
    has, itself, bent down to the point where Sweden looks like a
    low-transmission US state at this point. And Sweden is a data point
    for the argument that you could get herd immunity at 20 percent or
    25 percent.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    I don’t think that they’ve actually done very well, right? They have
    higher infection rates than their neighboring countries. They have a
    pretty high mortality rate. I don’t think they’re anywhere near herd
    immunity. In fact, there was an open letter written by, I think, 20
    or 30 epidemiologists, including some from inside Sweden, saying
    they’re not even close to herd immunity. There’s still high
    susceptibility in the larger population, and their economy doesn’t
    appear to be doing much better than their neighbors’ economies for
    the strategy that they took.

  - ross douthat  
    I want to be clear on what I’m saying. I don’t think the Swedish
    strategy has contained the virus more effectively than their
    neighbors. It clearly has not.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    OK.

  - frank bruni  
    So what are you saying?

  - ross douthat  
    I’m saying that if you look at a chart right now of Sweden’s total
    cases and daily new cases and total deaths, the death line has
    flattened. The total case line has almost flattened. And daily new
    cases have done a big arc and now are very low. Sweden has death
    rates that are worse than Denmark and Norway that did severe
    lockdowns, but it’s death rates are not nearly as bad as some of the
    worst centers of the epidemic. That cries out for an explanation. So
    I’m just saying, I think there are a lot of data points right now
    that suggests that something maybe limits the virus’ spread at
    around that 25 percent threshold.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    I take you at your word at what the Swedish curve looks like right
    now. I don’t think that that in any way implies that the herd
    immunity threshold there or anywhere else is necessarily 20 percent.
    I think there’s about 5,000 different potential explanations for
    that. I don’t think it’s a leap from they’ve managed to bend the
    curve down to they have herd immunity. And I think also to your
    earlier point —

  - ross douthat  
    Well, I want to be clear, there is herd immunity for the level of
    social distancing we have now.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Yeah, herd immunity is not a fixed number.

  - ross douthat  
    Exactly.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Exactly, yeah. So that’s fine. But what I was arguing earlier, you
    want to make decisions about what things need to be closed down,
    what things can be reopened, how much social distancing you need,
    whether you want mask-wearing indoors, outdoors, everywhere based on
    what the case positivity rate is in a given area. Now, if you’re
    basing it on the data, then you’re doing it the right way. Whether
    you’re at a thing that you can reasonably define as herd immunity or
    not is kind of incidental. So I feel like you’re arguing for herd
    immunity as a strategy, even though I know you say you’re not. I’m
    just not sure how to understand that.

  - ross douthat  
    No, I think we agree.

  - frank bruni  
    \[LAUGHING\] I don’t know about that.

  - ross douthat  
    I think, in part, it’s a question about our level of optimism going
    forward and how bad we expect the disease to get in the fall. I
    think that we agree that you want basically a data-driven assessment
    of the disease’s prevalence in your community. And I agree, that’s
    more important than a theory of herd immunity that might be proven
    wrong.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Yeah, again, I don’t think we know the number for SARS-CoV-2 at all.
    I just don’t think it’s going to end up being near 20 percent, based
    on what I’ve seen. The other thing I would point out is in places
    like New York and I think in most of the Northeastern United States,
    studies have shown, the thing that they seem to have done right is
    to be much slower to open indoor dining and to open bars.

  - ross douthat  
    Yes. And I think New York City is particularly good at that, and I
    think that’s why things are much better in the Northeast than they
    are in other parts of the country. But again, that goes back to not
    throwing your hands up or saying, it’s great that we’re also
    libertarian here. It’s basically based on data. So based on data,
    we’re not going to open the bars and restaurants, and we’re going
    to be able to maybe open the schools in the fall. It’s a trade-off.
    Well, and that I guess can be our last question for you, which is,
    should the schools open in the fall?

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Again, I think it should be based on data. And I think if you do it
    based on the data and you say, OK, we have to have a certain
    positivity rate to safely open the schools, what you’re going to
    find quickly from there is, OK, how do we get to that positivity
    rate? Well, the first thing you have to do is think about whether
    you want to keep your indoor dining open, whether you want to keep
    your bars open. And then I think the conclusion is that you probably
    don’t.

  - ross douthat  
    But in practice, it seems like a lot of places have chosen indoor
    dining and bars over schools. And you also have a dynamic where you
    have certain states that maybe have a transmission spread rate that
    is low enough to reopen schools aren’t reopening them. This seems to
    be happening in the mid-Atlantic. And then states that have a higher
    transmission rate — Georgia, Texas, and so on — are opening them. So
    I think there is a wariness about just following the data in liberal
    states, as well as conservative states. And the sort of polarization
    that once Trump said, let’s open the schools, suddenly there was —

  - jeneen interlandi  
    “That’s a terrible idea\!”

  - ross douthat  
    — political pressure not to open them in places that could.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    You have these two kind of conflicting things in play at the same
    time. On one hand, it’s extreme fatigue on the part of everybody. I
    don’t care what your political persuasion is. You’re fatigued right
    now from all of the closures and just the abnormal existence we’ve
    had. And then on the other hand, if you have gains and you’ve
    managed to get to a place — if you live in Manhattan like I do —
    where you’re not hearing ambulances go down your street literally
    every five minutes and you’re terrified to even just go outside,
    you’re terrified of losing those gains. So you have this kind of
    terror and also this fatigue happening at the same time, and I think
    that’s part of where we’re at.

  - ross douthat  
    Well, I think terror and fatigue is a good place to close this
    discussion.

  - frank bruni  
    Jeneen, thank you so much.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Thanks, this was fun.

  - ross douthat  
    Jeneen, we’ll have you back at Christmas when we’ll all have herd
    immunity, and we’ll look forward to that.

  - jeneen interlandi  
    Our holiday special, OK. Thanks, guys.

  - ross douthat  
    We’ll be right back.

  - frank bruni  
    Welcome back. We’re going to talk about American Catholicism, which,
    in an age of polarization, is a rare institution that sprawls across
    our political divide. It’s a church with a progressive-leaning pope
    and a conservative American hierarchy. It’s the church of Attorney
    General William Barr and of Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for
    president. It cuts across class. It cuts across ethnicity, which
    means that it’s uniquely cross-pressured. To talk about some of
    those pressures, we’ve invited our colleague Liz Bruenig. Liz,
    thanks so much for joining us on “The Argument” today.

  - liz bruenig  
    Thanks for having me on.

  - frank bruni  
    Liz, you recently wrote an op-ed about American Catholicism’s unease
    with the Black Lives Matter movement. “Racism Makes a Liar Out of
    God” was the terrific headline on your extremely interesting piece.
    Tell us about the argument you made.

  - liz bruenig  
    Well, thanks very much. I was interviewing Gloria Purvis, who’s a
    Black Catholic journalist, in a sense, and that she has run a
    broadcast radio show on EWTN, which is the largest Catholic media
    distributor in the world. She also had a television show. And one of
    EWTN’s local affiliates, the Guadalupe Radio Network in Texas, which
    is, I believe, one of their largest affiliates, if not the largest,
    dropped her show after the murder of George Floyd because she began
    to speak out quite vociferously about racism. And my response to
    that was just that it wasn’t particularly Catholic of them, that she
    wasn’t saying anything unorthodox, that everything she was saying is
    completely evinced and held up by church teaching. And so I just
    don’t think it should be that hard for Catholics to look at the
    claims being made, put aside various organizations, whether you like
    certain figureheads and so on and so forth, and just focus on the
    arguments emerging from this movement. And I think they’re pretty
    easy to endorse for a Catholic. I don’t see the hang-up.

  - frank bruni  
    So why, then, do you think she was dropped? How do you explain? Is
    that about racism? Is it about particular and peculiar discomfort
    with Black Lives Matter? What’s going on?

  - liz bruenig  
    I think it’s probably somewhat to do with particular discomfort with
    Black Lives Matter, and I think quite a lot of it has to do with the
    fact that having uncomfortable conversations doesn’t necessarily
    make for good radio. People don’t like to sit around and listen to
    people really hash out issues of life and death import — and she has
    co-hosts who sometimes have friendly disagreements with her —
    because that can be very distressing to hear, the same reason people
    don’t want to have those conversations interpersonally. And so I
    think it was a combination of that and widespread conservative
    mistrust of the Black Lives Global Network, this organization that
    has laid claim to the phrase “Black Lives Matter,” which, of course,
    preceded it.

  - frank bruni  
    One thing I wanted to ask you before we went on any further is when
    we’re talking about the Catholic Church, what are we really talking
    about, and how much meaning does that phrase have? And what I mean
    by that is I would probably be in a pollster’s box as a Catholic
    because I was raised in the Catholic Church, although I drifted far,
    far away. I believe you are a convert to Catholicism. Ross has his
    own relationship to Catholicism. So there are Catholics who care
    about what the pope says, and there are Catholics who never look in
    this direction. So what do we mean here by the Catholic Church?

  - liz bruenig  
    Well, it’s a global institution, and so every Catholic’s response to
    various world goings-on is going to be different. And I think when
    we we’re talking about the Catholic Church in this context, we refer
    to a number of things. The Catholic Church refers to, at times, the
    hierarchy, the church authorities. It, at times, refers to the
    laity, everyone who is baptized Catholic and receives the sacraments
    and is confirmed to the church. And then at times, it refers to the
    internal logic, the tradition, the rules of the Catholic Church. It
    takes all of those things to constitute it. So I think we’re always
    referring to a sort of mixture of things there.

  - ross douthat  
    In many ways, the church feels incredibly weak at this moment, and
    its sort of sprawl seems like part of its weakness, that it’s sort
    of been through a period of decline. It had the sex abuse crisis.
    It’s had this sort of internal argument over its own teachings,
    that, for my sins I’ve been involved in. And so things like the
    Black Lives Matter movement come along, and there is no Catholic
    authority figure or authority figures capable of saying, OK, we’re
    going to harness the church’s sprawl and spread to support this
    movement or to critique this movement or somewhere in between. And
    instead, you get this sort of very American, I guess,
    entrepreneurial thing where certain people appoint themselves a
    spokesman for Catholicism, and you have these particular clashes,
    like the one around Gloria Purvis. But there’s no sense of
    Catholicism as something that’s capable of coming together and
    playing a dynamic role at this moment. Although, but Liz, you sort
    of end your piece by suggesting that the bishops could do that to
    some extent?

  - liz bruenig  
    Well, the bishops could put the hierarchy behind the March for Black
    Life in Washington D.C., which is what the open letter calls for, is
    for the bishops to join that march. What the bishops can’t do it
    they can’t make anyone like it, and the church teaching already
    supports. So that’s two out of three. It’s not bad. But American
    Catholics — and at this point, Catholics all over the world,
    especially in North America and Europe — these are liberal subjects.
    So their approach to Catholicism is not the approach to Catholicism
    that someone alive during the counter-reformation would have taken.
    It’s an approach to Catholicism that’s informed by the general
    ideological atmosphere around here, which is I decide what sounds
    good to me, and I discard what doesn’t. And I am the sovereign of
    myself, and I operate within certain parameters. But very little is
    binding on me. And so you have some American Catholics who say, OK,
    if the hierarchy says we do it and it matches the church teaching,
    then we do it. It doesn’t really matter if it matches our other
    intuitions.

  - ross douthat  
    So let me push you a little bit on the dilemma here. I’m going to
    quote a not African-American, but African cardinal, Wilfrid Napier,
    who is from South Africa —

  - liz bruenig  
    That’s not the one I was expecting.

  - ross douthat  
    That’s not the one you’re expecting — who is, himself, Black. This
    is how the hierarchy of the church now manifests itself, in tweets.
    But he tweeted, Black Lives Matter creates real conflict of
    conscience. The mission statement of BLM-GNF — that’s the
    organization you were talking about earlier — advocates views on
    marriage and family that are totally repugnant to Catholic teaching,
    as are the actions of its activists. Yet there is an urgent need to
    expose all injustice against people of color. So this, I think,
    coming from outside the U.S., but it’s still, I think, distills the
    dilemma for Catholics who are maybe more sympathetic to the cause of
    criminal justice reform or police reform than some of the people who
    wanted Gloria Purvis’ show canceled, but I’d say the sort of current
    protest politics in its organizational and institutional forms and
    see a movement that is much more secular and left wing than was, for
    instance, the Civil Rights Movement at its peak, right? It’s not
    emerging out of the African-American church. Its rhetoric emerges
    out of an academic milieu that is, I think it’s fair to say, is
    pretty hostile to traditional Christianity and Catholicism. And as
    you just mentioned, in the penumbra of these riots, you get a lot of
    attacks on churches — not tons and tons, but there’s been a real
    uptick in vandalism of Catholic churches, some of it focused on
    figures like Saint Junipero Serra, who is a controversial figure for
    reasons related to the treatment of Native Americans under the
    mission system in California. But some of it is just sort of more
    all-purpose, right? Acts of vandalism that just knock the head off a
    statue of the Virgin Mary or something. And so it seems like there
    is actually some dilemma here where you’re trying to figure out, how
    do you lend your support to the cause of racial justice without
    ending up just as sort of a religious ally of a movement that is
    pretty hostile to Catholicism?

  - liz bruenig  
    I don’t think that the attacks on churches and statues have been
    anti-Catholic in particular. They tend to be people who are upset
    about, as you said, Spanish colonialism, the treatment of Native
    Americans under the Spanish colonial regime. So there have been
    attacks on missions. There have been attacks on statues of Saint
    Junipero Serra. With any protest, especially of this size, you’re
    going to get some delinquent sort of vandalism that has nothing to
    do with the protest at all. It’s just people doing things they
    cannot normally do and kind of having a libidinal moment there where
    they go a little crazy. I think quarantine has compounded this
    already-existing tendency. But I wouldn’t look at it as these people
    are anti-Catholic, they want the Catholic Church destroyed. That may
    well be in the case of some people. If you’re on the internet, you
    hear from those people every day.

  - ross douthat  
    I’ve never heard from those people. I don’t know what you mean.

  - liz bruenig  
    \[LAUGHS\] Yeah, who could they possibly be? We could probably
    rattle off some handles. But in reality, it seems like, you look at
    polling, the majority of Black people are Christians. And so it’s
    not the case that the Black people who are calling for an end to
    police violence are dead set on the destruction of the nuclear
    family or whatever. That might be the case with these activists who
    are writing the copy, but the Black Lives Matter Global Network is
    not a membership organization. You don’t have to pay dues and if you
    don’t pay your dues, you can’t show up to the protest. The
    organizing efforts against anti-racism don’t require you to
    participate in whatever efforts there are or may be to destroy
    statues or undermine the church. On the other hand, the church is
    pretty good at undermining itself, so it doesn’t really need any
    help.

  - frank bruni  
    So when someone like Andrew Sullivan, whom you mentioned in your
    column, says Black Lives Matter and Catholicism are incompatible, is
    he kind of focusing on a detail that is less meaningful than he’s
    making it out to be?

  - liz bruenig  
    I think his complaint was that the Black Lives Matter Global Network
    is Marxist and that you can’t be a Marxist and a Catholic. You can,
    actually. I have this on good authority.

  - ross douthat  
    In a very complicated sort of way.

  - liz bruenig  
    \[LAUGHS\] Marxism can be said in many ways, as I imagine Aquinas
    would have put it. And so I tend to think that people like Andrew
    would probably not be in favor of this movement in any universe,
    right? And so the Catholicism issue is an opportunity to make a
    shell argument that’s not substantive. It’s about something else.
    It’s a procedural objection. Oh, well, I would, but I have all
    these other things that I have to subscribe to ahead of this, so I
    can’t.

  - ross douthat  
    Well, OK, but people are not wrong to look at the current moment of
    protest and say, well, this seems to be about not just racism and
    police brutality, but also a kind of substantial reordering of elite
    American institutions, for instance, in ways that are sort of much
    more secular and left wing than movements that the Catholic Church
    usually associates itself with and more hostile to not just Catholic
    beliefs on one particular issue, but the wider panoply of beliefs,
    right?

  - liz bruenig  
    Right. No, I think that’s true. I think that no institution coming
    out of American soil shares the aims of the Catholic Church. These
    are all liberal institutions. Their aims are circumscribed by the
    event horizon of temporality, right? So this is to say, the goals of
    all of the institutions that come out of American thought and
    American life, these are liberal institutions that have goals that
    are sort of utilitarian, or they have to do with sort of freedom and
    equality. And those are aspects of Catholic teaching. They’re
    certainly not the end goal of Catholic teaching. So then the
    question is, how distant is this particular movement from Catholic
    Church teaching, and how distant can a movement be before we have to
    completely abandon it? And I would say that all that’s required is a
    little of that good old discernment that we hear about so often,
    especially from our Jesuit friends, which would be paying attention
    to what aspects of the movement are being foregrounded and in what
    way you’re being asked to support it. So if there is, say, a
    referendum in your city on police funding or the ways in which
    police can or should try to de-escalate, as opposed to defaulting to
    violence, or body cams or something like that, you can go ahead and
    think, what is the best way to cast a vote here that is going to
    hopefully create a more equitable landscape in this city for the
    people who live here with me? You don’t have to affirm in the
    strongest terms even the entirety of the movement. But to the degree
    that you have power as a citizen, I think it’s probably pretty easy
    to exercise that in a way that comports with any racist goals.

  - frank bruni  
    Liz, what do you make of Trump’s attacks on Biden’s Catholicism or
    on Biden’s religion, which is thus implicitly Catholicism? And do
    you think Biden’s Catholicism factors into, colors this coming
    election in any interesting ways?

  - liz bruenig  
    Trump is an interesting figure in that he sort of doesn’t even
    really put up the bare pretense of being all that interested in
    religion.

  - frank bruni  
    \[LAUGHING\] He does hold a Bible upside down very photogenically.

  - liz bruenig  
    Right, he’ll do stuff like that, which is vaguely insulting, and go
    stand out in front of a church. And the tone of that is always like,
    you piggies sure love this slop, don’t you? Lap it up. \[BRUNI
    LAUGHS\] And it’s a little insulting. I don’t like it when any
    politicians talk about their religion. I’ve never heard one of them
    do it in a way that was remotely convincing, and Trump, in
    particular, just doesn’t even really bother with it, which I kind of
    grudgingly respect because it’s so clearly a charade. The ones that
    try to be earnest about it are, in some ways, a little more
    disturbing to me. But he has no room to attack Joe Biden’s
    Catholicism, the nature of which I know nothing about. And to the
    degree that it will even matter at all in the election, which I
    doubt it will, it could be good for Biden. Catholics are classic
    swing voters. There are lots of Catholics in swing states. Catholics
    typically split right down the middle, 50-50, Republican-Democrat.
    And if he can pull any Catholics who wouldn’t have otherwise given
    him a shot because he is Catholic, that’s possible, and that’s
    interesting, I suppose. But my feeling is that American Catholicism
    has been so thoroughly Protestantized that it doesn’t really matter.
    And moreover, very few Protestants could tell you in what ways
    Catholics are morally different than they are in the United States,
    right? So back in the day, you would have been called a crypto
    Catholic if you said something like, well, whether or not you go to
    heaven depends a lot on you. But this is also just sort of common
    American Protestant thought at this point. It’s rather unusual to
    find very vocal Calvinists. And so because the lines between
    Catholicism and Protestantism the United States are sort of blurred
    at this point— the evangelicalized Catholics on the right and then
    the sort of liberalized Protestants who have kind of lost a lot of
    those puritanical elements of Protestantism on the left— I just
    don’t really think it matters. It’s definitely not going to be a
    JFK-type situation.

  - frank bruni  
    Well, and what you’re saying makes me think that’s one of the
    reasons why Trump instinctively attacked Biden’s religion in the
    larger sense and not necessarily his Catholicism because I think he,
    at some level, understands what you just said, which is that people
    don’t necessarily see these bold lines where they once saw them
    between Protestantism and Catholicism.

  - ross douthat  
    Trump is going for the idea, which is a true idea that among white
    Americans, there is a real pew gap between the parties, in the sense
    that Republicans are more likely to be church-goers, and Democrats
    are not. And there is an odd reversal of that in the actual leaders
    of the parties, in that Trump is not a church-goer and Joe Biden is.
    So Trump, in his way, is sort of going right at that and saying, oh,
    you think Biden’s a church-goer, well, he’s against God, right? I
    mean, that’s sort of the classic Trump.

  - frank bruni  
    What does that even mean, Ross?

  - ross douthat  
    Well, I may not go to church, but he’s against God.

  - frank bruni  
    What does that even mean when he said he’s against God? What does
    that even mean?

  - ross douthat  
    Well, it’s like when Trump was asked, back when he was first trying
    to figure out how to talk like a pro-lifer, and he said something
    about how, well, we really need to punish women who have abortions,
    which is not and has never been the main pro-life position on the
    issue. But to Trump, it seemed like something that he imagined a
    pro-life person would say. And I think you get some of that in the
    against god rhetoric, too.

  - liz bruenig  
    Yeah, Trump was just doing logic in that case.

  - frank bruni  
    \[LAUGHING\] Wait, wait, wait, wait, Liz, did you really just use
    Trump and logic in the same phrase?

  - liz bruenig  
    I’m not kidding. He was sitting there. He knows nothing about
    Christianity in America. He knows nothing about the pro-life
    movement. He’s not remotely interested in any of these issues. And
    so someone asks him, do you think that women who have abortions
    should be punished? So he has to come up with an answer on the spot
    because he has no relationship to this movement. And he’s like,
    well, yeah, I mean, I guess. They say it’s murder so yeah. \[BRUNI
    LAUGHS\] And that’s like very basic \[LAUGHS\] logic he was
    performing there. And again, he did the same thing with Biden where
    he’s like, well, damn, if you’re not with him, you’re against him.
    So the question is, are the people that Biden is competing for with
    Trump — the swing people that Biden needs to grab — are they really
    interested in hearing a bunch of legitimate-sounding Christian
    rhetoric, or are these people who are interested in something else?
    And will the swing vote come down to that? I am not actually
    convinced that religion will play that big of a role in the swing
    vote.

  - ross douthat  
    I think Trump would have been better served just attacking Biden on
    the issue of abortion, where Biden actually used to be closer to the
    center and has moved more to the left in his campaign, and just made
    it an issues-based appeal because I think there are a lot of
    Americans who are conflicted about abortion who are swing voters.
    
    Put it this way — I think the swing voters, Liz, think the basic
    idea of Joe Biden as a guy who goes to mass on Sunday and doesn’t
    always agree with his church, that’s them, too, right? So saying
    that those kind of people are somehow against God, it’s just an
    attempt to mobilize people already voting for Trump, not to win over
    the undecided.

  - frank bruni  
    We have to let Liz go in a moment. But before we go, Liz, I
    understand you may have a recommendation for our listeners.

  - liz bruenig  
    So I would recommend logging off, which is not to say not using your
    computer or whatever. That’s just a tool. But get off social media.
    You know what I mean. I think most of the people who say log off
    point to the fact that there’s so much misinformation and lying on
    the internet that it can really cloud your judgment, and that’s
    true. But worse is that there is so much true information on the
    internet. And I don’t think we’re actually particularly
    well-designed to cope with getting news of the entire world updated
    every 10 minutes on a live stream. I think it’s extremely stressful.
    It’s too much true information. And I think that it can lead to a
    real sort of spiritual darkness. It used to be the sole province of
    God to know a full accounting of all the human evil that was
    happening at any given time. Now it’s the province of any Twitter
    user, and it’s a heavy burden. So log off. I close Twitter for six
    hours a day at a time and have nothing to do with it, and I’m much
    happier knowing less.

  - frank bruni  
    Thank you for that, Liz, and thank you so much for coming on the
    show.

  - ross douthat

Five months after the editorial board’s science writer Jeneen Interlandi
warned the hosts of “The Argument” that they should get comfortable in
quarantine, she makes her return to the podcast to talk what comes next.
Ross and Frank press Jeneen on herd immunity possibilities, how to fix
the testing lags in the U.S., and the question on every parent and
teacher’s mind: How can we open schools safely?

Then, Opinion writer Elizabeth Bruenig joins Frank and Ross for a debate
on the moral obligations of the Roman Catholic Church in 2020. If the
Movement for Black Lives is promulgating Catholic beliefs, why won’t the
church say “Black Lives Matter”? And how will Joe Biden’s Catholicism
play a role in the election? Finally, Elizabeth recommends a break from
omniscience.

I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist for The Times since 2011, but my career
with the newspaper stretches back to 1995 and includes many twists and
turns that reflect my embarrassingly scattered interests. I covered
Congress, the White House and several political campaigns; I also spent
five years in the role of chief restaurant critic. As the Rome bureau
chief, I reported on the Vatican; as a staff writer for The Times’s
Sunday magazine, I wrote many celebrity profiles. That jumble has
informed my various books, which focus on the Roman Catholic Church,
George W. Bush, my strange eating life, the college admissions process
and meatloaf. Politically, I’m grief-stricken over the way President
Trump has governed and I’m left of center, but I don’t think that the
center is a bad place or “compromise” a dirty word. I’m
Italian-American, I’m gay and I write a [weekly Times
newsletter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/newsletters/frank-bruni)
in which you’ll occasionally encounter my dog, Regan, who has the run of
our Manhattan apartment.

I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics,
religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they intersect.
I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m
against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to
agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the
rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald
Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and
America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to
the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P.,
American Christianity and Pope Francis, and decadence. Benedict XVI was
my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong
opinions about many prestige television shows. I have four small
children, three girls and a boy, and live in New Haven with my wife.
