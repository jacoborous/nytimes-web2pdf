An ex-boyfriend's run-ins with the law entangled her even as she tried
to move on. Interviews, documents and jailhouse recordings help explain
how she landed in the middle of a deadly drug raid.

By Rukmini Callimachi

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

LOUISVILLE, Ky. ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/breonna-taylor-police.html}{Breonna
Taylor} had just done four overnight shifts at the hospital where she
worked as an emergency room technician. To let off some steam, she and
her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, planned a date night: dinner at a
steakhouse, followed by a movie in bed.

Usually, they headed to his apartment, where he lived alone and she had
left a toothbrush and a flat iron. But that night, they went to the
small unit she shared with her younger sister, who was away on a trip.
It was dark when the couple pulled into the parking lot, then closed the
door to Apartment 4 behind them.

This was the year of big plans for the 26-year-old: Her home was
brimming with the Post-it notes and envelopes on which she wrote her
goals. She had just bought a new car. Next on the list: buying her own
home. And trying to have a baby with Mr. Walker. They had already chosen
a name.

She fell asleep next to him just after midnight on March 13, the movie
still playing. ``The last thing she said was, `Turn off the TV,''' he
said in an interview.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/09/04/universal/04nytp-breonnapic/04nytp-breonnapic-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v5.jpg}

From the parking lot, undercover officers surveilling Ms. Taylor's
apartment before a drug raid saw only the blue glow of the television.

When they punched in the door with a battering ram, Mr. Walker, fearing
an intruder, reached for his gun and let off one shot, wounding an
officer. He and another officer returned fire, while a third began
blindly shooting through Ms. Taylor's window and patio door. Bullets
ripped through nearly every room in her apartment, then into two
adjoining ones. They sliced through a soap dish, a chair and a table and
shattered a sliding-glass door.

Ms. Taylor, struck five times, bled out on the floor.

Breonna Taylor has since become an icon, her silhouette a symbol of
police violence and racial injustice. Michelle Obama and
\href{https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/breonna-taylor/2020/08/19/dnc-2020-hillary-clinton-name-drops-breonna-taylor-george-floyd/5613797002/}{Kamala
Harris} spoke her name during their speeches at the Democratic
convention. Oprah Winfrey ceded the
\href{https://www.npr.org/2020/08/01/898099594/oprahs-o-magazine-honors-breonna-taylor-in-historic-cover}{cover
of her magazine} for the first time to feature the young Black woman,
and paid for billboards with her image across Louisville.
\href{https://www.beyonce.com/image/letter-to-attorney-general-daniel-cameron/}{Beyoncé
called for} the three white officers who opened fire to be criminally
charged. N.B.A. stars including LeBron James devoted
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/24/us/nba-breonna-taylor-spt-trnd/index.html}{postgame
interviews} to keeping her name in the news.

In Louisville, demonstrators have led nightly protests downtown, where
most government buildings and many businesses are now boarded up. As
outrage mounted, the city fired one of the officers, pushed out the
police chief and passed ``Breonna's Law,'' banning ``no-knock''
warrants, which allow the police to burst into people's homes without
warning. Protesters say that is not enough.

Nearly six months after Ms. Taylor's killing**,** the story of what
happened that night --- and what came before and after --- remains
largely untold. Unlike the death of George Floyd, which was captured on
video as a white police officer in Minneapolis knelt on his neck, Ms.
Taylor's final moments remain **** in shadow because no such footage
exists.

But a clearer picture of Ms. Taylor's death and life, of the person
behind the cause, emerged from dozens of interviews with public
officials and people who knew her, as well as a review of over 1,500
pages **** of police records, including evidence logs, transcripts of
jailhouse recordings and surveillance photos. The Louisville Metro
Police Department, **** citing a pending investigation, declined to
answer simple questions about the case or make anyone available for
interviews.

The daughter of a teenage mother and **** a man who has been
incarcerated since she was a child, Ms. Taylor attended college, trained
as an E.M.T. and hoped to become a nurse. But along the way, she
developed a yearslong relationship with a twice-convicted drug dealer
whose trail led the police to her door that fateful night.

Sloppy surveillance outside her apartment in the hours before the raid
failed to detect that Mr. Walker was there, so the officers expected to
find an unarmed woman alone. A failure to follow their own rules of
engagement and a lack of routine safeguards, like stationing an
ambulance outside, compounded the risks that night.

While the department had gotten court approval for a ``no-knock'' entry
to search for evidence of drugs or cash from drug trafficking, the
orders were changed before the raid to ``knock and announce,'' meaning
that the police had to identify themselves.

The officers have said that they did; Mr. Walker says he did not hear
anything. In interviews with nearly a dozen neighbors, only one person
said he heard the officers shout ``Police!'' a single time.

Sam Aguiar, a lawyer representing Ms. Taylor's family, blames
``catastrophic failures'' by the police department for the young woman's
death. ``Breonna Taylor,'' he said, ``gets shot in her own home, with
her boyfriend doing what's as American as apple pie, in defending
himself and his woman.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/27/multimedia/00breonna-billboard/merlin_175626375_2355c94f-0748-488f-baae-1c93779899f2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Ms. Taylor had been focused on her future with Mr. Walker. But her
history with 30-year-old Jamarcus Glover, an on-again off-again
boyfriend who had spent years in prison,~was hard to escape, even after
she cut ties with him a month before the raid. When the officers rammed
the door of the apartment, Mr. Walker later explained, he fired his gun
because he feared it was her ex-boyfriend forcing his way in.

Although Ms. Taylor had no criminal record and was never the target of
an inquiry, Mr. Glover's frequent run-ins with the police entangled her.
She had been interviewed in a murder inquiry, and paid or arranged bail
for him and his associates.

When Mr. Glover called from jail after an earlier arrest in January, she
told him that his brushes **** with the law worried her, according to a
recording; **** each said ``I love you'' before hanging up. A GPS
tracker the police placed on his car later showed him making ****
regular trips to her apartment complex, and surveillance photos showed
her outside a drug house.

In a series of calls hours after her death, as Mr. Glover **** tried to
make bail, he told another woman that he had left about \$14,000 with
Ms. Taylor. ``Bre been having all my money,'' he claimed. The same
afternoon, he also told an associate he had left money at Ms. Taylor's
home.

Mr. Aguiar, the lawyer for her family, said that no drugs or cash were
found at her apartment after the raid. Thomas B. Wine, the Jefferson
County prosecutor, countered that the search was called off once the
shooting occurred.

With three investigations underway, including a federal civil rights
inquiry, a full public accounting of the botched raid is not yet
possible. A city on the defensive has withheld some of the most basic
information about the case, roiling public anger. Even as new details of
her ties to the drug dealer have emerged, including the jailhouse
recordings
\href{https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/breonna-taylor/2020/08/25/report-details-why-louisville-police-decided-to-forcibly-search-breonna-taylor-home/5593502002/}{first
reported by The Louisville Courier Journal}, city officials have made a
point of not excusing the outcome of the raid. Mayor Greg Fischer said
in a
\href{https://twitter.com/louisvillemayor/status/1298243342128615427}{statement}:
``Breonna Taylor's death was a tragedy. Period.''

Christopher 2X, a longtime \href{https://2xgamechangers.org}{community
organizer} whom Ms. Taylor's family turned to after her death, said her
relationship with Mr. Glover had to be acknowledged. ``You can't just
look away from it and act like it's not there,'' he said. ``My hope is
courageous people will say: `There it is --- it's what it is --- but was
this shooting justified? She should be alive today.'''

\subsection{`This Agency Isn't Really Built for
Us'}\label{this-agency-isnt-really-built-for-us}}

The fumbled raid that resulted in the young woman's death was
paradoxically set in motion by an attempt at police reform.

The impetus came in spring 2019, when a
\href{https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/investigations/2019/04/04/louisville-kentucky-police-stopped-frisked-handcuffed-black-teen-for-wide-turn/3210229002/}{video}
went viral showing a Black teenager being pulled over and handcuffed. He
was his high school's

king}. His offense was making a wide turn.

The department would be sued at least three times that year for racial
bias by Black motorists. They included the teenager, who had borrowed
his mother's car to get a
\href{https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/investigations/2019/04/04/louisville-kentucky-police-stopped-frisked-handcuffed-black-teen-for-wide-turn/3210229002/}{slushy};
a father and his 9-year-old son, who were boxed in by police cars for
failing to signal; and a man and his caregiver who were stopped for an
obstructed windshield, then told to stand barefoot on the asphalt as the
car was searched.

In each instance, the police looked for drugs and found none**.**

The week that the video of the teenager was uploaded to YouTube
coincided with a visit to the department by Robin Engel, the director of
the University of Cincinnati
\href{https://www.theiacp.org/research}{Center} for Police Research and
Policy. Her research helped shape a model of policing credited with
cutting violent crime in
\href{https://www.theiacp.org/sites/default/files/Research\%20Center/CPD\%20PIVOT\%20Goldstein\%20Submission.pdf}{Cincinnati}
and
\href{https://www.theiacp.org/sites/default/files/Research\%20Center/Crime\%20Place\%20Networks\%20in\%20Las\%20Vegas\%20-\%20Police\%20Chief\%20Magazine.pdf}{Las
Vegas}.

She recalled that the police chief at the time, Steve Conrad, asked her:
How can we do better?

Tensions between the Louisville department and the city's Black
residents had accrued over decades of heavy-handed policing and
discriminatory practices. A federal consent decree in the 1980s required
the department to hire one Black officer for every two white recruits,
with the goal of raising Black representation on the force to 15
percent. Nearly 40 years later, in a city that is almost
\href{https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/louisvillejeffersoncountybalancekentucky}{one-quarter}
African-American, only 10 percent of the force's 1,154 officers are
Black, according to a spokeswoman.

``The trauma of it, the reality of it, just set in for so many of us
that this agency isn't really built for us,'' said Charles Booker, a
state representative in Kentucky who is Black.

What Ms. Engel proposed was a departure from traditional practices in
Louisville and other cities. Instead of targeting a large area for
frequent traffic stops or going after specific criminals who are quickly
replaced, focus on
\href{https://www.theiacp.org/sites/default/files/Research\%20Center/RIB-Place-Based-Investigations-to-Disrupt-Crime-Place-Networks\%20(1)\%20(1).pdf}{micro-locations}:
a storefront, a parking lot, a city block. The idea was to identify
spots conducive to crime and adopt remedies, like cutting tall grass in
a neighborhood where felons hide guns, or putting ``No Parking'' signs
along a street where drug dealers idle in cars.

In December 2019, the Louisville Police created its
\href{https://louisville-police.org/Directory.aspx?did=65}{Place-Based
Investigations unit}, and after analyzing crime statistics, decided to
focus on
\href{https://louisvilleky.gov/sites/default/files/mayors_office/news_images/elliott_ave_project_timeline_2020.pdf}{Elliott
Avenue}, a street of dilapidated and abandoned houses, according to city
records.

Nearly every year since 2014, a timeline provided by the city shows that
at least one killing occurred there, most of them on the 2400 block. In
2014,
\href{https://www.wdrb.com/news/teenage-girl-shot-to-death-in-russell-neighborhood/article_f6f75191-dd9e-531c-afb3-a93f4a88a605.html}{a
teenage girl} was shot multiple times; in 2015, a 49-year-old man was
\href{https://www.wdrb.com/news/police-arrest-suspect-after-man-found-engulfed-in-flames/article_c5437513-0000-59b9-a5f1-ead248db4200.html}{doused
in lighter fluid} and set on fire; in 2016, a man was
\href{https://www.wdrb.com/news/crime-reports/lmpd-investigating-fatal-shooting-in-russell-neighborhood/article_097d3cd6-24e9-5038-be8b-80de9425fdb7.html}{fatally
shot}; in 2018, a homicide victim was found in his home; and in 2019, a
bystander died in a shootout, according to city
\href{https://louisvilleky.gov/sites/default/files/mayors_office/news_images/elliott_ave_project_timeline_2020.pdf}{records}.

The focus on Elliott Avenue dovetailed with an existing city project to
redevelop a swath of the predominantly Black neighborhood with **** over
\$30 **** million in federal grants. Since 2017, the city had been
foreclosing on blighted properties to demolish them and make way for new
low-income and affordable housing, according to interviews with city
officials and the
\href{https://louisvilleky.gov/sites/default/files/mayors_office/news_images/elliott_ave_project_timeline_2020.pdf}{timeline}
they provided.

Mr. Aguiar, who has brought a wrongful-death lawsuit on behalf of Ms.
Taylor's family, has criticized the effort as gentrification run amok
--- an attempt to deliver a political win for the mayor, causing the
police to overreach. But community leaders and residents say they
welcomed the investment.

Pointing to a street-side memorial for a shooting victim, the Rev. Paul
Stillwell asked, ``Are we not allowed to dream?''

of stashing drugs and weapons. Surveillance reports put her car at the
house multiple times.Credit...Joshua Rashaad McFadden for The New York
Times

By the end of 2019, the city had taken possession of nearly half of the
vacant buildings and was working to acquire the rest --- among them 2424
Elliott, 2425 Elliott, 2426 Elliott and 2427 Elliott. There, according
to court records, Jamarcus Glover and his associates operated a series
of ``trap houses,'' where they stashed crack cocaine, marijuana and
prescription pills.

An informant sent inside No. 2424 reported that six men were packaging
crack cocaine and passing it to customers through a mail slot in a
security door.

On Dec. 30, days after the new squad was started, police executed search
warrants at Nos. 2424 and 2426 and a house a few blocks away, seizing
eight guns, a surveillance system and 4.9 grams of crack, according to a
police log. Mr. Glover was arrested, along with five others, and soon
released on bail.

On Jan. 2, Detective Joshua Jaynes of the Place-Based Investigations
unit asked for a camera to be installed overlooking the 2400 block of
Elliott, according to an internal report he signed. Within an hour, it
had captured between 15 and 20 cars briefly stopping in front of No.
2424. ``Indicative of narcotics trafficking,'' his report says.

At 5:53 p.m., a white Chevrolet Impala pulled up in front of the house,
and Mr. Glover exited. The car was registered to Breonna Taylor, the
report says.

Over the next two months, the new squad surveilled the Elliott addresses
where Mr. Glover operated, and Ms. Taylor's apartment 10 miles away. A
GPS device the police put on Mr. Glover's car tracked it to her
apartment complex six times, according to the internal report. And Ms.
Taylor's new car --- a Dodge Charger --- was seen at the trap house on
multiple occasions; she was photographed in front of it in
mid-February**.**

Image

Ms. Taylor had an on-again off-again relationship with Jamarcus Glover,
a convicted drug dealer who listed her apartment as his address and used
it to receive packages.

The evidence collected on the Elliott houses was extensive, according to
an application for a warrant to search the premises. And it appears to
have been accurate: The same March night as the raid on Ms. Taylor's
apartment, the police struck No. 2424, where they found a table covered
in drugs packaged for sale, including a plastic sachet containing
cocaine and fentanyl, police logs and a laboratory report show.

But the information the police had compiled to suggest that Ms. Taylor's
apartment was used in the operation was thinner.

State and federal officials are investigating whether detectives had
enough evidence to tie Ms. Taylor to Mr. Glover when they sought the
warrant to search her apartment. Mr. Aguiar has argued that the police
did not have adequate justification for the raid, and both he and
\href{https://www.whas11.com/article/news/local/no-knock-warrants-eliminate-aclu-ky/417-768ce3ae-dab8-4030-9fc6-bc271fe0a6f0}{the
A.C.L.U.} have objected to the use of a no-knock warrant.

That type of warrant is typically used in narcotics investigations when
the police need the element of surprise to disrupt criminal activity and
prohibit suspects from destroying evidence, said Walter P. Signorelli,
former head of narcotics at the New York Police Department and author of
\href{https://www.amazon.com/Criminal-Procedure-Evidence-Walter-Signorelli/dp/1439854491}{a
book on criminal law}. It **** is also considered
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/03/18/us/forced-entry-warrant-drug-raid.html}{high
risk}; multiple jurisdictions across the country banned such warrants
after innocent people were mistakenly killed in raids.

Judge Mary Shaw, who signed the order, said she had ``asked needed
questions of the officer, reviewed the affidavits prepared for each
warrant and subsequently made the probable-cause determination required
of me by law.''

The warrant cited five pieces of information establishing what the
police said was probable cause: Mr. Glover's car making repeated trips
between the trap house and Ms. Taylor's home; her car's appearance in
front of 2424 Elliott on multiple occasions; surveillance footage of him
leaving her apartment with a package in mid-January; a postal
inspector's confirmation that Mr. Glover used her address to receive
parcels; and database searches indicating that as of late February, he
listed her apartment as his home address.

But since Ms. Taylor's death, what has emerged in bank statements,
cellphone records, bail paperwork, audio recordings of police
interrogations and other documents is a trail of evidence pointing to a
complicated liaison between her and Mr. Glover, dating back to 2016.

Mr. Aguiar **** said in a statement last week that the police department
had gone to ``great lengths after Breonna died and this case received
national scrutiny to dig up all of her past.''

But the lawyer also
\href{https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/breonna-taylor/2020/08/25/report-details-why-louisville-police-decided-to-forcibly-search-breonna-taylor-home/5593502002/}{apologized}
to the public for having previously understated the extent of her
relationship with the drug dealer, saying he had been unaware of the
jailhouse recordings.

Court records show that Mr. Glover was convicted of selling cocaine and
spent years in prison, starting in 2008 in his home state of
Mississippi, where he was handed a 17-year sentence. In 2014, after
moving to Kentucky, he was convicted of a second drug offense. He began
dating Ms. Taylor in 2016, according to a statement he gave the police.

That December, a favor he asked of her --- renting a car and lending it
to him --- ensnared her in a murder inquiry. A man was found slumped
over the wheel, eight bullets riddling his body. Inside the car were
three baggies of drugs and Ms. Taylor's rental contract, court records
show.

Mr. Glover told officers he had given the keys to a man he knew as
``Rambo,'' who said he had to run an errand. The **** internal police
report **** states that the victim was the brother of an associate of
Mr. Glover, who had been arrested alongside the drug dealer numerous
times. A
\href{https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2017/02/01/louisville-man-arrested-murder-drug-charges/97329308/}{suspect
in the shooting} was charged nearly two months later.

Investigators noted that they believed Ms. Taylor had no knowledge of
the killing. But they wondered whether she was involved in Mr. Glover's
drug operation, according to a recording of a detective questioning
them.

``Are you all into the game?'' the detective, Yolanda Baker, asked the
couple at Ms. Taylor's apartment. When Mr. Glover demurred, she pressed,
``So how are you getting all these little fine things you've got on?''

In the years that followed, as Mr. Glover was in and out of jail on drug
charges, Ms. Taylor paid at least \$7,500 in bail for him and an
associate in 2017 and 2019, according to bond paperwork.

At the start of this year, Mr. Glover was detained again, held at the
Louisville Metro Department of Corrections jail. He phoned her, one of
48 jailhouse calls to her cellphone from him and other prisoners in the
last four years, according to the report. His tone in the Jan. 3 call
was demanding. ``I was sleeping. I am so sorry,'' she responded,
according to a recording.

He told her whom to contact to arrange his bail, and added that after he
was released, he would ``come get me some rest in your bed.''

``When you around, I stress more,'' she told him. ``Because I just
always be worried about you,'' she said, ``with the police.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/09/28/video/28vid-audio-breonna-taylor/28vid-audio-breonna-taylor-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg}

Later that month, Mr. Glover opened a Chase bank account, listing her
apartment as his home address. He then made three Zelle transfers to her
phone for \$150, \$200 and then \$225.

In recorded jailhouse calls, he complained to a friend that the police
saw the transactions as suspicious when they were only meant to
reimburse Ms. Taylor for paying his cellphone bill. The police later
retrieved an AT\&T payment reminder from Mr. Glover's phone: ``Your
online bill is ready, BREONNA,'' it said.

Hours after the raid and Ms. Taylor's death, he claimed during a
recorded jailhouse call to another girlfriend that Ms. Taylor had been
holding thousands of dollars for him. On the call, Kiera Bradley, with
whom he has a daughter, asked where to find bail money.

``Bre had, like, eight grand,'' he said.

``Bre had eight grand of your money?'' Ms. Bradley responded, her voice
rising.

``Yeah,'' he said. When another man joined the call, he added: ``She had
the eight I gave her the other day, and she picked up another six.''
Later, he said, ``Don't take it wrong, but that Bre been having all my
money.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/09/28/video/28vid-audio-breonna-taylor/28vid-audio-breonna-taylor-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg}

His claim could not be verified, though he also told another associate
there was money at Ms. Taylor's home. ``It was there, it was there, it
was there,'' he said in a recorded call that day.

Mr. Glover, who had become a fugitive, was arrested on Thursday in
possession of drugs, according to a charging document. He told
\href{https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/breonna-taylor/2020/08/27/breonna-taylor-had-no-ties-drugs-ex-boyfriend-says/5641151002/}{The
Courier Journal} that Ms. Taylor had no involvement in the drug trade.
``The police are trying to make it out to be my fault and turning the
whole community out here, making it look like I brought this to
Breonna's door,'' he said.

In the terabytes of call logs, surveillance tapes, database searches and
other evidence detailing her connection to Mr. Glover, the Louisville
police appeared to miss the new arc that the young woman's life had
taken, an oversight that would have calamitous consequences.

``Breonna was a woman who was figuring everything out in her life, who
had turned a corner,'' said Mr. Aguiar, the lawyer. ``Breonna was
starting to live her best life.''

Ms. Taylor was born in Grand Rapids, Mich., to a 16-year-old single
mother. Her father, Everett Taylor, has been in prison since she was a
child, the lawyer said. He was convicted of murder when she was 6, after
shooting a man who had failed to pay for a rock of crack cocaine, court
records show.

Family and friends describe the mother and daughter as close. ``She was
a better version of me,'' said her mother, Tamika Palmer, a dialysis
technician. ``Full of life. Easy to love.''

As a girl, Ms. Taylor was considered by other parents to be the
responsible one among their daughters' friends. She woke them up to get
to school on time after sleepovers, practiced mock interviews for an
after-school job in ninth grade in Louisville, where her family had
moved, and tried to dream big.

``Graduating this year on time is so important to me because I will be
the first in my family to accomplish this,'' she wrote in her scrapbook
during her senior year, next to a photo of herself in a cap and gown.
``I want to be the one who finally breaks the cycle of my family's
educational history. I want to be the one to finally make a
difference.''

She enrolled at the University of Kentucky and a year later, in 2012,
began a banter on Twitter with Mr. Walker, then a student at a
university two and a half hours away. He was 20, she was 19. The
flirtatious tweets grew into a friendship, and then a romance four years
later, according to his account.

``I kept on telling her, I don't want to be friends no more,'' he
recalled in an interview. ``But I'm a Gemini, and she was also a Gemini.
So, you know, some days it was, `Yeah let's, let's get married and have
a kid,' and another day it's like, ``No, let's be single and live
carefree lives.''

They began dating in the summer of 2016, he said. But a few months
later, she started seeing Mr. Glover. For nearly four years --- until
weeks before her death --- she went back and forth between the two men,
Mr. Walker told the police.

Her family and friends are effusive about Mr. Walker, a former warehouse
worker for Coca-Cola, describing him as ``good for her'' and ``a man who
treated her right.'' None of them would discuss Mr. Glover.

Her social media posts and Mr. Glover's, combined with court and police
records, suggest he came into her life at a low point: She had dropped
out of college and become an E.M.T., but she quit after a year,
discouraged by the 16-hour shifts and low pay.

At times, she struggled to afford groceries, she said in one
\href{https://twitter.com/PrettyN_Paidd/status/1205144818101473280}{tweet}.
In another she wrote: ``I pray 2018 is a better year for me financially.
I mean by the grace of God, I always made sure my bills were covered but
it's been a long struggle \& I'm over it.''

Around that time, her younger sister, Juniyah, moved in with her. Ms.
Taylor was intent on setting a good example for her and for an infant
goddaughter who began spending several nights a week at their home,
according to Mr. Aguiar.

``These two beautiful little girls right here are my world,'' she wrote
in her scrapbook. ``They look up to me, so when they're around it's
almost like I become an entire new person. I know they're watching my
every move, so I make sure I don't do anything wrong.''

Those who knew her describe her as loving and fun --- she adored fast
cars and hot sauce. Her friends joked that she would put it on pancakes.
``It was the Bre way,'' said her cousin Preonia Flakes. ``She was
`extra' and we loved her.''

She had long been interested in medicine. As a girl, she asked
permission to prick her grandmother's finger to test her insulin level,
her mother recalled. At 23, she became a patient care assistant at
Frazier Rehabilitation Institute, part of the University of Louisville
Health hospital, tending to people recovering from traumatic injuries,
said Jessica Jackson, a co-worker who led her orientation.

On her first day, and nearly every day after, Ms. Taylor showed up 20
minutes early, forcing Ms. Jackson --- who had been written up for
tardiness --- to start arriving on time. ``She was a go-getter,'' Ms.
Jackson said.

At home, Ms. Taylor began writing goals on every scrap of paper --- junk
mail, napkins, envelopes --- her mother said. ``She would just make
these bullet points. `I want to have this done by this time,''' she
recalled.

And among friends and family, Ms. Taylor became a motivator. She told
Ms. Jackson that she wanted to get her nursing degree, and helped her
friend, who had already done the coursework, study for the boards.

One day, Ms. Taylor sent her friend a screenshot of a
\href{https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7846813/Envelope-help-save-extra-5-050-end-2020.html}{saving
system} she had seen on Facebook, involving numbered envelopes that
guide how much money to set aside each week. In a year, you could save
enough for a down payment on a car, Ms. Jackson explained.

In January, Ms. Taylor drove home her brand-new Dodge Charger: sleek and
jet-black, with an engine that made a loud growl. ``2020 deff gonna be
my year WATCH!'' she
\href{https://twitter.com/PrettyN_Paidd/status/1192024507676078080}{tweeted}.

In mid-February, she finally ended her relationship with Mr. Glover and
committed to Mr. Walker, her family's lawyer said. Among her last
\href{https://twitter.com/PrettyN_Paidd/status/1231786160051060737}{tweets}
was a message about setting a good example: ``Gotta watch how you let
men treat/deal with you especially when you got lil sisters/cousins
looking up to ya!!''

The night of the March raid, the plainclothes narcotics officers staking
out the young woman's apartment on Springfield Drive did one last
drive-by at about midnight. Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly said that he and
Detective Mike Campbell drove along the front of the apartment complex
and took note of the blue light emanating from the TV in Ms. Taylor's
bedroom, according to his statement to investigators.

Though they had been assigned to be the ``eyes'' on the apartment
buildings, they had failed to notice that she was not alone when her car
pulled in a few hours earlier, according to
\href{https://www.nbcnews.com/video/new-audio-of-police-officer-sheds-light-on-police-investigation-into-breonna-taylor-s-death-86779973611}{police
statements} and court motions.

They did not see Mr. Walker getting out with Ms. Taylor. They missed the
couple, returning from their dinner at Texas Roadhouse, entering
Apartment 4, the door decorated with vibrant letters: H, O, M and E.

They had the apartment to themselves: Her sister was in California, and
her goddaughter was with relatives. Ms. Taylor now worked the overnight
shift in the
\href{https://www.springvalleyfuneral.net/obituaries/Breonna-Taylor?obId=12420734}{emergency
room} of University of Louisville Health's Jewish Hospital East. She was
expecting an 11 p.m. phone call, requesting her to come in, Mr. Walker
later told police. When the call didn't come, she baked cookies, they
played Uno and then they curled up to watch ``Freedom Writers,'' in
which Hilary Swank plays a teacher in a racially divided district.

``It was more like the movie was watching us than we were watching it,''
Mr. Walker recalled.

In a pre-operation briefing before the raid, Sergeant Mattingly was told
that she was home alone. ``They said they did not believe she had
children or animals but they weren't sure,'' he later
\href{https://www.nbcnews.com/video/new-audio-of-police-officer-sheds-light-on-police-investigation-into-breonna-taylor-s-death-86779973611}{told}
investigators. ``Said she should be there alone because they knew where
their target was,'' he said, referring to Mr. Glover. ``And I guess they
thought he was her only boyfriend or acquaintance.''

Around the same time that the two undercover officers were doing their
last drive-by of her apartment, a team of officers was executing three
search warrants on Elliott Avenue. Five ``no-knock'' warrants had been
signed by a judge that afternoon seeking evidence of drug trafficking by
Mr. Glover and his associates.

In executing the warrants on Elliott Avenue, the police spared no
resources: More than 60 officers flooded the street. They included a
militarized SWAT unit, multiple lieutenants and sergeants and several
ambulance crews, according to the lawsuit filed by Ms. Taylor's family.

The swarm of officers beat down the doors at 2424, 2425 and 2426 Elliott
without incident, recovering large quantities of crack and Fentanyl
pills in a bag hidden in a tree, as well as cash, digital scales and
guns. They also found signs of attempts to get rid of evidence: cocaine
flushed in the toilet, according to police evidence logs and summaries.
Mr. Glover and four others were arrested and taken to jail.

By contrast, the crew poised outside Ms. Taylor's apartment with a
battering ram was smaller and less equipped, with eight or 10 officers,
according to the conflicting accounts of the police department and the
family's lawyer. They were undercover, not using body cameras, and
wearing tactical vests, not the elaborate protective gear worn by the
SWAT team. An ambulance on standby outside was told to leave about an
hour before the raid, counter to standard practice.

Although the warrant for Ms. Taylor's house had been approved as a
``no-knock,'' the officers were instructed at the briefing that they
should do a ``knock-and-announce'' --- knock first, then identify
themselves as the police and give Ms. Taylor a chance to come to the
door --- according to Sergeant Mattingly.

A little after 12:35 a.m., the officers lined up in the breezeway.
Sergeant Mattingly was closest to the apartment door. Detective Myles
Cosgrove was next to him, and farther back were Detective Brett
Hankison, Lt. Shawn Hoover and others.

Apartment 4 sits in a complex of two-bedroom units covered in beige
vinyl siding. Ms. Taylor's 950-square-foot apartment was on the ground
level, and a floor-to-ceiling sliding-glass door gave way to her patio,
which faced the parking lot. Blinds covered the door and the window.

``When we all got up in line, I knocked on the door,'' Sergeant
Mattingly told investigators. ``Our intent was to give her plenty of
time to come to the door because we said she was probably there alone,''
he said. ``Banged. No response. Banged on it again. No response. At that
point we started announcing ourself, `Police, please come to the
door!'''

On the other side of the locked door was a 25- to 30-foot hallway,
cutting through the living room, passing her sister's empty bedroom and
ending at the door to Ms. Taylor's bedroom.

The loud banging jarred her awake. ``It scared her to death,'' Mr.
Walker said in his
\href{https://www.nbcnews.com/video/new-audio-of-breonna-taylor-s-boyfriend-sheds-light-on-police-investigation-into-her-death-87241797969}{statement}
to the investigators. ``First thing she said was, `Who is it?' No
response,'' he recounted. ``Another knock at the door. She's like, `Who
is it?' Loud at the top of her lungs. No response.''

They jumped out of bed and rushed to get dressed. In the confusion, Mr.
Walker put on his girlfriend's pants.

The knocking continued. Mr. Walker, a licensed gun owner who said he'd
never discharged his weapon outside a firing range, grabbed his
9-millimeter Glock.

They left the bedroom and crept down the hallway toward the front door,
which vibrated with each booming knock. ``She's yelling at the top of
her lungs and I am, too, at this point, `Who is it?' No answer, no
response, no anything,'' he said.

Among the officers outside her door were men who had been trained by
David James, the city council president. During his 19-year career as a
police officer, he had instructed recruits at the local training academy
about ``dynamic entry.'' Especially when executing a warrant at night,
he said, he told them to yell ``police'' at the top of their lungs,
specifically so that occupants would not mistake them for an intruder.

``So everyone can hear,'' he added. ``Neighbors. People down the
street.''

By nearly all accounts, that did not happen at Apartment 4.

Almost a dozen neighbors interviewed for this article said that they
never heard the police calling out, including Clifford Tudor, who had
stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. Only one person, a truck driver
coming off his shift, said he heard the officers shouting. Aaron Julue
Sarpee had left his 2-year-old in the care of the woman living directly
above Ms. Taylor. Before the police lined up, he had run upstairs and
picked up his sleeping toddler. He had just stepped out onto the
exterior staircase when he saw the officers.

raid, said the police announced themselves only once.Credit...Joshua
Rashaad McFadden for The New York Times

Before they ordered him to go back inside, Mr. Sarpee said, he heard at
least three loud bangs as they knocked on Ms. Taylor's door, and heard
one or more officers scream ``Police!'' --- a single time. He is
emphatic that they said it only once.

Mr. Wine, the county prosecutor, said both the police version and Mr.
Walker's account of events could be correct: Through the door, he
suggested, the police and the couple inside did not hear each other.

Because Mr. Walker said he did not realize who was at the door, he made
a tragic assumption: The apartment was being broken into --- and not
just by anyone. He thought it was Ms. Taylor's ex-boyfriend, he later
told the police.

``We've been on and off together, whatever, for like, seven years,'' he
said. ``So there was a guy that she was messing with, or whatever,
throughout that time, you know. And he popped up over there once before
while I was there, like, a couple months ago,'' he explained. ``So
that's what I thought was going on.''

Sergeant Mattingly said that as soon as the door was punched in and he
cleared the threshold, he could see to the end of the long hallway.
There, in silhouette, he saw a male and a female figure. The man's hands
were stretched out, holding an object.

``As we're coming to the door, the door, like, comes off the hinges,''
Mr. Walker said. ``It's like an explosion.'' He went on: They were
scared. He thought someone was breaking in. He was trying to protect his
girlfriend. ``So, boom, one shot. Then all of a sudden there's a whole
lot of shots,'' he said. ``I just hear her screaming.''

Kentucky law is clear: Under the
\href{https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/self-defense-and-stand-your-ground.aspx}{stand-your-ground}
statute, citizens can use deadly force against an intruder inside their
own home. But like numerous other jurisdictions, Kentucky also has a
statute protecting police officers who use deadly force in self-defense.

Sometime between 12:41 and 12:42 a.m. according to call logs, the rights
guaranteed by those statutes clashed.

``As soon as the shot hit, I could feel the heat in my leg,'' Sergeant
Mattingly recounted in his statement. ``And so I just returned fire,''
he said, adding that he shot at least four rounds immediately, and
another two soon after. Behind him, Detective Cosgrove also returned
fire into the hallway, according to police statements.

The bullet tore through the sergeant's thigh, piercing the femoral
artery. He scooted out onto the breezeway, then stumbled into the
parking lot, where he collapsed, he recalled.

Meanwhile, a barrage of bullets ripped into the apartment from another
direction. Detective Hankison had left the formation near the door, run
into the parking lot and begun firing through the covered patio door and
window, according to police records.

Unlike the two officers standing in the doorway, the 44-year-old
detective probably has no self-defense claim, several local officials
said. The bullets he shot from the parking lot tore diagonally through
Ms. Taylor's apartment and into Apartment 3 directly behind it, where a
pregnant woman and a 5-year-old were sleeping.

His behavior was reckless, the department concluded, because he shot 10
rounds blindly, and it was not directed against someone who posed an
immediate threat. He was fired in June. ``I find your conduct to be a
shock to the conscience,'' the interim police chief said in a
termination
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/LMPD.ky/photos/pcb.10158939624887269/10158939619232269/}{letter}.

In nearly two decades with the department, Detective Hankison had
received multiple complaints of excessive use of force as well as sexual
misconduct, according to portions of his personnel file obtained by The
Times. Most of the complaints appear to have been dismissed or not
considered credible.

One record showed he was reprimanded at least three times: for
improperly charging a man with having a concealed weapon in 2005; for
trying to extract crack cocaine from a suspect's mouth and failing to
call an ambulance; and for causing a car wreck in 2016 that fractured
the spine of another officer.

He and the two other officers involved in the shooting could not be
reached for comment. Sergeant Mattingly and Detective Cosgrove have been
placed on administrative leave, according to a department spokeswoman,
Jessie Halladay.

Mr. Walker was charged with attempted murder for shooting Sergeant
Mattingly; the charges were
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/us/Breonna-Taylor-Kenneth-Walker.html}{later
dropped}.

Because no ambulance had been staged, the police spent the next critical
minutes trying to get medical help for the injured officer.

``I kept going, `Where's E.M.S.?''' said Sergeant Mattingly.

Radio logs paint a scene of chaos. An ambulance rushing to the apartment
complex went to the wrong entrance, blocked by a locked gate. On the
radio, officers yelled instructions to ram the vehicle through the gate.
But the ambulance didn't get past **** the crushed metal. Colleagues
tried to put Sergeant Mattingly in the back seat of a squad car, but he
couldn't bend his leg. They tried to put him in the trunk, but it was
**** blocked by a gun case. Finally, they laid him atop the trunk.

As officers outside scrambled to help him, no aid was rendered to Ms.
Taylor. It wasn't until 12:47 a.m. that emergency personnel realized
that she was seriously wounded, after her boyfriend called 911.

``I don't know what's happening. Someone kicked in the door and shot my
girlfriend,'' Mr. Walker cried on a
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0EnRabtRhg}{recorded call} to
911.

When the operator asked if the young woman was alert and able to speak,
he said: ``No, she's not,'' and then, ``Oh my God. Oh my God.''
