The authorities said an earlier sexual assault charge was the reason for
the restraints, which were removed on Friday.

KENOSHA, Wis. --- Days after a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake
outside an apartment building, the authorities on Friday provided new
details on what led up to the videotaped encounter that has prompted
heated street protests and calls for reform.

Law enforcement officials said that in recent days they had shackled Mr.
Blake to his hospital bed, where he is paralyzed from the waist down
from his wounds, because he faced an arrest warrant from July on charges
of third-degree sexual assault, criminal trespass and disorderly
conduct. The same woman who had filed that complaint had called 911
before the shooting on Sunday to report Mr. Blake's presence to the
police, according to interviews and records.

Some onlookers and Ben Crump, the civil rights lawyer who is
representing Mr. Blake, have described Mr. Blake as a peacemaker who was
seeking to break up a disturbance involving two women when the police
arrived. On Friday afternoon in Wisconsin, near the spot where Officer
Rusten Sheskey fired at Mr. Blake seven times, some of those who knew
Mr. Blake said the authorities were attempting to justify a clear-cut
instance of excessive force by tarnishing his reputation.

``They're trying to reverse it and make it seem like he was such a
criminal,'' said Jesse Franklin, a community activist who described Mr.
Blake as a laid-back father who spent considerable time with his
children. ``The whole point is, I don't care if he's a criminal or has a
record. Your life matters, too. He's not less of a man. He's a human
being with kids, with a family, with a heartbeat.''

At a news conference on Friday, Chief Daniel Miskinis of the Kenosha
Police Department said he believed that the officers knew of the
outstanding warrant when they responded to the call about a domestic
dispute.

The outstanding warrant, he said, would have brought a ``heightened
awareness'' to the dynamic between the officers and Mr. Blake. ``There
was some resisting on the basis of that contact and the arrest, so that
is what changed the dynamics,'' he said.

The union representing Kenosha police officers issued a statement on the
events that led up to the shooting, suggesting that Mr. Blake had
strongly resisted arrest, fighting with officers, putting one in a
headlock and ignoring orders to drop a knife that he held in his left
hand.

``None of the officers involved wished for things to transpire the way
it did,'' Brendan P. Matthews, a lawyer representing the union, said.
``It is my hope that truth and transparency will help begin and aid in
the healing process.''

The shooting was troubling enough that Mayor John Antaramian of Kenosha
said in an interview on Friday that it ``was a situation that, I think,
caught all of us a little off guard.'' The Police Department ``has had
some very good rules in dealing with use of force,'' he added, though he
stopped short of saying whether he believed that the officers violated
the use-of-force rules.

Protests have played out around the country in recent days, and more
were planned over the weekend. On Friday, thousands of protesters
gathered in Washington at the Lincoln Memorial for an event aimed at
rekindling the spirit of the 1963 March on Washington in which the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his ``I Have a Dream'' speech.

The family of Mr. Blake was among relatives of victims of police
violence who spoke from a lectern at the base of the memorial.

``There are two systems of justice in the United States,'' Mr. Blake's
father, Jacob Blake Sr., said. ``There's a white system and there's a
Black system. The Black system ain't doing so well.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/28/us/28KENOSHA-blakesr/merlin_176304732_eb9f8a03-db8b-4003-abad-ec8ee2223f66-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

In an interview later on Friday, the elder Mr. Blake said he planned to
take part in a rally in Kenosha in honor of his son on Saturday. He said
he had not heard from officials of that city since the shooting.

``My plan is to march peacefully,'' he said. ``I would like the chief of
police or somebody up high to come outside and explain to me, face to
face, why it was OK for that police officer to put seven shots in my
son's back.''

Court documents filed in the July case against Jacob Blake show that the
woman who filed the complaint said he had broken into her home while she
was asleep and assaulted her. The woman told the police that Mr. Blake
also took her car and debit card, the documents show.

Patrick Cafferty, who is representing Mr. Blake in that case, which
includes a felony count and two misdemeanors, declined to discuss the
charges, except to say that his client would be pleading not guilty.

Amid growing questions about Mr. Blake being shackled to his hospital
bed, officials said on Friday that the shackles were being removed. Mr.
Cafferty said he had discussions with the Kenosha district attorney,
Michael D. Graveley, who agreed to vacate the arrest warrant. Law
enforcement often uses restraints and police guards in hospital rooms
when a patient is facing criminal charges.

Mr. Crump issued a statement, which read, in part, ``Fortunately, a man
who is paralyzed and fighting for his life after being shot seven times
in the back will no longer have to deal with the pain of having his
ankles and wrist shackled and the traumatic stress of being under armed
guard.''

That decision does not stop the criminal case against Mr. Blake from
proceeding. ``The merits of the case have not been addressed,'' Mr.
Cafferty said.

Family members of Mr. Blake declined to comment on the charges, which
they said were irrelevant to the police shooting.

``The Blake family is exhausted,'' said an uncle, Rick Blake, who
described a large and diverse extended family. ``We are teachers, we are
lawyers, we are government officials, we are everyday working people.''

``We have a right to be angry,'' he said. ``We also have a right to call
out for justice.''

In interviews with local media after the shooting, the woman who had
accused Mr. Blake of assault was also critical. ``You shot him numerous
times, for no reason,'' she said. ``It didn't take all that.''

Mr. Blake, 29, is the father of six children, ages 3 to 12, and was
working at an automotive facility, training to become a mechanic, his
family said.

Before the shooting, his father said, he had enjoyed fishing and
boating. Now, he has said from the hospital that he never wants to go
outside again.

``He is scared right now, and he has every right to be scared,'' the
elder Mr. Blake said. ``Wouldn't you be?''

Before the police shot Mr. Blake, officers had twice tried to use a
Taser on him, state officials said. Two officers --- Officer Sheskey and
Vincent Arenas --- had each discharged Tasers before Officer Sheskey
fired his gun at Mr. Blake. Both officers, as well as a third officer at
the scene, Brittany Meronek, have been put on administrative leave.

Officials in Kenosha said they were bracing for the weekend, with
hundreds of members of the Wisconsin National Guard deployed amid unrest
that at times has grown violent, with two people killed in a chaotic
confrontation this week between counterprotesters and protesters.

John Eligon reported from Kenosha, and Richard A. Oppel Jr. and Sarah
Mervosh from New York. Julie Bosman contributed reporting from Kenosha,
Michael Wines from Washington, and Bryan Pietsch from Denver.
