Everything}\label{trying-to-make-it-big-online-getting-signed-isnt-everything}}

Young people come to Los Angeles in droves with dreams of fame and
fortune. Once they're discovered, it's not always sunny.

This spring, Marcus Olin moved into a sprawling mansion in the Los Feliz
section of Los Angeles with seven other TikTok creators. His bedroom
overlooked downtown Los Angeles, and waking up to the view every morning
felt like a dream.

``I was like, `Man, that's my city,''' Mr. Olin, 21, said. ``I felt like
I owned it.''

The Kids Next Door, as Mr. Olin and his housemates are known, is one of
many influencer
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/03/style/hype-house-los-angeles-tik-tok.html}{collab
houses} that have formed in Los Angeles over the last year. Several of
them have leases that are signed or co-signed by talent management
companies.

In the case of the Kids Next Door house, that leaseholder was Ariadna
Jacob, the founder and chief executive of a talent management firm
called Influences.

The deal was this: Ms. Jacob agreed to pay about half of their monthly
rent of \$18,500. In exchange, the tenants would produce content and
fulfill a certain number of brand deals obtained by the company.

``We went into this thinking we'd have brand deals weekly or monthly,''
Mr. Olin said. ``We were expecting a quota where we could pay our half
of rent through brand deals. But we weren't getting enough deals to
cover our half of rent.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/14/fashion/14INFLUENCES-olin/14INFLUENCES-olin-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

That wasn't all. ``We didn't have working Wi-Fi for a month,'' said
Jesse Underhill, 22, another member of the house. ``We couldn't go live
because our livestreams would cut out.''

He struggled financially after moving into the house. ``I used to get
three to five brand deals a week,'' Mr. Underhill said. ``Since I moved
in, it's one every two weeks, and they're lowballing.''

At the end of July, the influencers were told that they would have to
cover a larger share of rent. They all felt the crunch, and the dream of
living and working in a mansion with friends turned into ``a living
nightmare,'' Mr. Underhill said. By early August, half of the residents
had moved out. The house itself has been re-listed

sale on Zillow}.

For decades, young and creative people have come to Los Angeles with
visions of fame, fortune and fulfillment. Some have found it; many more
have learned that getting discovered isn't so easy.

Over the past year, dozens of TikTok stars have had the rare experience
of becoming household names --- at least in \emph{some} rooms of the
household --- overnight. Multinational companies now enlist them for
campaigns,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/style/hollywood-agents-influencers.html}{major
Hollywood talent agencies have signed them}, and managers are looking to
cultivate them.

There are several established management companies that work with
influencers across the social media landscape. Many formed in step with
the influencer economy in the 2010s, signing talent from YouTube and
Instagram. More recently, a class of boutique firms has emerged to guide
the careers of TikTok's young stars.

Ariadna Jacob founded Influences in 2018, the same year
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/10/style/what-is-tik-tok.html}{TikTok
merged with Musical.ly}. The company's
\href{http://influences.com/}{website} names brands like Disney,
Coca-Cola and Johnson \& Johnson among its clients. By January of this
year,
\href{https://www.businessinsider.com/top-influencer-agents-managers-database-youtube-instagram-tiktok-2020-6}{Business
Insider} had named Influences and Ms. Jacob one of the top creator
managers, and the company was working with some of the most notable
influencers on TikTok, including Addison Easterling and Charli and Dixie
D'Amelio.

Also among Ms. Jacob's clients at the time: Brittany Tomlinson, whom Ms.
Jacob had approached after a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/20/style/kombucha-internet-viral.html}{video
of her reaction to a taste of kombucha went viral}.

``Ari DMed me on Twitter and was like, `I'm seeing this image of you
going around a lot, have you made any money?''' Ms. Tomlinson, 22, said.
She said that Ms. Jacob told her she owned an ad agency and could get
her a deal with a kombucha brand. All Ms. Tomlinson needed to do was a
sign a contract.

Ms. Tomlinson signed a nonexclusive agreement with Ms. Jacob in August
2019. A month later, she signed a new contract, making the arrangement
exclusive.

Ms. Tomlinson flew to Los Angeles in September and stayed at Ms. Jacob's
apartment. ``She's buying me lunch and dinner. She claims she's mentored
by Gary Vee,'' said Ms. Tomlinson, referring to the entrepreneur Gary
Vaynerchuk. ``I met all these people who she said will help my career.''
(Mr. Vaynerchuk said he has no affiliation with Influences.)

In December, Ms. Tomlinson moved to Los Angeles. She had started doing
brand deals for companies like FabFitFun and GT's Kombucha and even
filmed a Super Bowl commercial for Sabra hummus with Charli D'Amelio.

``By January, I realized I hadn't been paid since Halloween,'' she said.

Ms. Tomlinson reached out to the brands she'd worked with and discovered
that she was owed tens of thousands of dollars. In April, she filed a
complaint with the California Labor Commission, on the grounds that Ms.
Jacob had violated California law by operating as a talent agency
without a license.

In it, she claims Ms. Jacob is withholding \$23,683.82 in fees; that Ms.
Jacob ``demanded unconscionable fees'' of up to 20 percent commission;
and that Ms. Jacob bought and is squatting on the domain name
brittanybroski.com.

``She tries to lock creators into contracts,'' said Ms. Tomlinson, who
is now managed by Brillstein Entertainment Partners. Her case remains
pending.

``Ms. Jacob has conducted herself with the utmost professionalism and
courage in the face of individuals who attack her both personally and
professionally. These individuals attacking her don't want to play by
the rules of decent individuals in society, but want to attack Ms. Jacob
publicly from the shadows, talking to any individual who is willing to
listen to them,'' said Ben Walter, a lawyer for Ms. Jacob.

``In an ethical management talent relationship you should be able to
part ways at any time,'' said Lisa Filipelli, a partner at Select
Management Group, a digital talent management firm. ``Any management
contract with a creator should be at will. Less mature companies have
manipulated what the word `signed' means.''

Chas Stahl of Right Angle Management said that forcing a client to stay
when their relationship with a manager has soured is unheard-of. ``Trust
in the relationship is so key,'' he said. ``Without that you can have
all the paperwork between the talent and a manager, but if you don't
have the trust in place it's not going to work.''

\subsection{`I Had to Make Tough
Decisions'}\label{i-had-to-make-tough-decisions}}

Ms. Jacob got her start in social media and marketing. In a statement to
The New York Times, she said that she entered the business to help young
people with big ideas.

``Little did I know that I would be entering what would become one of
the most competitive, cutthroat industries I've ever participated in,''
she said in the statement. ``I had to make tough decisions, often
unpopular, such as shutting down houses due to parties during the
Covid-19 pandemic, working with uncontrollable adolescents, and a
multitude of potential liabilities that I did not want to undertake.''

Ms. Jacob also said she wanted to protect creators from mistakes in the
industry --- ``the ugly part of Hollywood.''

``None of the creators who have left Influences were ever harmed,'' she
said in the statement. ``Instead some received free rent, a spot on a
Super Bowl commercial, trips on jets, private estates, professional
publicists and mentoring from the best in the business. None of them
have yet been sued and we have not hindered any of their careers in any
way whatsoever.''

Tianna Singer, 19, moved into the Girls in the Valley house, also
managed by Ms. Jacob, in late May. ``She promised brand deals, money and
opportunities,'' Ms. Singer said. ``Everyone was promised income, but
that never happened.''

Members of the house said that Ms. Jacob asked them to create free
branded content. ``She said we needed to show brands that we deserve to
work with them, and we needed to prove ourselves and it would help with
industry connections,'' Ms. Singer said.

Her housemates said that Ms. Jacob put a lot of pressure on them. ``She
would show up at all times of the night,'' Ms. Singer said. ``She'd come
as late as 1 a.m., and she'd be texting us until 3 a.m. and show back up
at 10 a.m. She'd bring guests with her without telling us.'' There was a
security camera in the kitchen of the house, which Ms. Singer said was
installed ``without our consent'' and connected to Ms. Jacob's phone.
Ms. Jacob said that the cameras were installed by the property owner for
security purposes.

The creators in the house said that on June 7, Ms. Jacob told them they
would be thrown out if they didn't post on social media at least eight
times a day. They felt unable to push back. ``We were often very
intimidated by Ari because the conversations became explosive,'' said
Ms. Singer.

In mid-June, Ms. Singer and others left the house. They described a
hectic move-out day that involved an escalating verbal fight with Ms.
Jacob which resulted in several calls to local authorities to intervene.
The group documented the day's events on Instagram Stories; Ms. Jacob
said she asked not to be filmed, but she recorded the events too. In an
email from her lawyer, Ms. Jacob denied that a fight took place.

Justin McWashington, 24, the live-in house manager for the Girls in the
Valley, said that the next day, he moved out. ``These houses look like
they're all sunshine and rainbows and gumdrops,'' he said, ``but at the
end of the day, it's toxic.''

Dayna Marie, 20, said that her months in the Girls in the Valley house
were some of the most stressful of her life. Her share of monthly rent,
which she paid, was \$1,500, but she realized immediately that some
bills weren't being paid.

``Ari told me all utilities are paid for,'' Ms. Marie said. ``But in
April the water, Wi-Fi and electricity went off. We were using water
from the pool to flush the toilets.'' Ms. Jacob said that she had agreed
to pay for utilities ``up to a certain point,'' and that she ``was under
no obligation to pay the bills.''

``This was during Covid, when we couldn't go anywhere else without
putting people at risk,'' Mr. McWashington said. ``We're all from out of
state, we had to tough it out and hope for the best.''

Ms. Jacob's lawyer described Ms. Jacob as a roommate herself, not as a
landlord, and therefore not responsible for the situation after she
``moved out." (In May, Ms. Jacob told The Times that she was the ``sole
lease holder'' for the house.)

``The whole Girls in the Valley house crashed at Drip Crib during the
whole Ari scenario,'' said Devion Young, 25, the founder of the Drip
Crib, which also had a relationship with Influences.

On June 9, Influences split from that group too, over disputes about
rent. On its
\href{https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1270440685456560128}{Instagram
account}, Influences said that
\href{https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-influencer-group-drip-crib-facing-disputes-over-rent-manager-2020-6}{members
of the Drip Crib breached their contract and failed to pay their share
of rent}.

``She manipulates you, it's a nightmare,'' Mr. Young said. He said that
she used nude photos of his to shame him.

``Right before we parted ways she leaked my nudes and sent them to
business partners, people in my house and potential investors to slander
my name, saying I was unprofessional,'' Mr. Young said. ``Ms. Jacob
informed an internal consultant of the picture's existence,'' Ms.
Jacob's lawyer wrote, and clarified that she did not ``publicly'' leak
the photos.

``We are focused on building talent who has their goals aligned with
something much more meaningful than `clout' and I think that's what this
is --- a desperate and sinister chase for clout at my expense,'' Ms.
Jacob said in her statement. ``Despite what's being said, my integrity
is intact and I don't think anyone should condone, especially The New
York Times, opportunistic bullying.''

By the time Tianna Singer was unpacking her bags at the Girls in the
Valley house, her mother, Salam Singer, was already nervous.

She wanted to give her daughter some autonomy, but worried about the
contract Tianna had signed and the amount of oversight Ms. Jacob would
be providing. ``You need a lot of structure when you're dealing with
young people,'' Ms. Singer said. ``They're basically forgoing college
and going into this like a career. So they need guidance and they need
to be told when to do what.''

Ms. Singer didn't expect things to devolve as quickly as they did. She
described Ms. Jacob's behavior in the end as ``shameful.''

``It's a very predatory environment,'' Ms. Singer said of the industry.
``You have a situation where you have young vulnerable people with the
potential to access a lot of money, then you have older people who are
going to take advantage of the situation. Tianna's not going to be the
first or the last.''

Sarah Zeiler, 46, met Ms. Jacob in April when Ms. Jacob attempted to
sign Ms. Zeiler's 16-year-old daughter, Ellie, to a management contract.
Ms. Zeiler declined but soon discovered that Ms. Jacob had already added
Ellie to the talent portion of an Influences marketing deck.

Ms. Zeiler emailed Ms. Jacob and asked her to remove Ellie's name and
image from the deck and to stop referring to herself as Ellie's manager.
``Ellie had heard from a few different notable people to be careful
because Ari will tell everyone she represents you, and that's exactly
what happened,'' Ms. Zeiler said.

Last week, Ms. Zeiler discovered that Ms. Jacob was still telling people
that she had a management relationship with Ellie. ``For any parent to
know that someone is out there saying that they're close with your child
and they represent them is uncomfortable and unsettling,'' she said,
adding: ``I didn't hire her for a reason.''

Many of Ms. Jacob's former clients are still in the process of
extricating themselves from Influences contracts and finding more
permanent housing. Most are wary of joining another content house.

Mr. Olin said he and his fellow housemates still fear legal action from
Ms. Jacob. ``Anytime talent wants to leave, she goes straight to suing
them,'' Mr. Olin said. ``I have asked her to release me from the
contract.''

Ms. Tomlinson said she still has not reached a resolution with Ms. Jacob
over her complaints. ``If I could give any piece of advice to young
creators,'' she said, ``it would be `don't sign anything.'''
