\section{Texas Hospital Says Man, 30, Died After Attending a `Covid
Party'}\label{texas-hospital-says-man-30-died-after-attending-a-covid-party}}

Health experts have been skeptical that such parties occur, and details
of this case could not be independently confirmed.

A 30-year-old man who believed the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/texas-coronavirus-rio-grande-valley-starr-county.html}{coronavirus}
was a hoax and attended a
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/arts/music/illegal-parties-coronavirus-europe.html}{Covid
party}'' died after being
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html}{infected}
with the virus, according to the chief medical officer at a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/texas-coronavirus-rio-grande-valley-starr-county.html}{Texas}
hospital.

The official, Dr. Jane Appleby of Methodist Hospital in San Antonio,
said the man died after deliberately attending a gathering with an
infected person to test whether the coronavirus was real.

In her statements to news organizations, Dr. Appleby said the man had
told his nurse that he attended a Covid party. Just before he died, she
said the patient told his nurse: ``I think I made a mistake. I thought
this was a hoax, but it's not.''

Health experts and public officials have cast doubt over whether ``Covid
parties'' are a real phenomenon, and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/us/coronavirus-covid-parties.html}{past
reports of such parties have fallen apart} or remained unconfirmed upon
closer examination.

The Times could not independently verify Dr. Appleby's account. On
Monday, the San Antonio health department said its contact tracers did
not have any information ``that would confirm (or deny)'' that such an
event had happened there.

In recent days, the hospital distributed video of Dr. Appleby
\href{https://abcnews.go.com/US/30-year-man-dies-attending-covid-party-thinking/}{describing
the case}, along with a press statement. She did not say when or where
the party took place, how many people attended or how long afterward the
man was hospitalized with Covid-19, the disease caused by the
coronavirus. She said she was sharing the story to warn others,
especially in Texas, where cases are surging.

The hospital, citing patient confidentiality rules, declined to publicly
identify the man. His family did not respond to several interview
requests passed along through the hospital.

Asked about skepticism about the story, Laura Breeden, a spokeswoman for
Methodist Healthcare, said, ``I was not there; however, Jane Appleby is
our chief medical officer. I believe what she says is true.''

There were 8,332 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the state on
Saturday, according to a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html}{New
York Times database}. Over 258,000 cases and more than 3,200 deaths have
been recorded in Texas so far. At least five people between the ages of
30 and 39 have died from coronavirus in San Antonio according to
\href{https://covid19.sanantonio.gov/About-COVID-19/Case-Numbers-Table-Data}{virus-tracking
efforts there}.

Past reports of ``Covid parties'' have fallen apart. County health
officials in southeastern Washington State
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/us/coronavirus-covid-parties.html}{reported
in May} that they had evidence that at least two coronavirus cases were
linked to one or more so-called Covid-19 parties, then quickly reversed
themselves, saying that the parties may have been more innocent
gatherings.

In Alabama,
\href{https://www.wbrc.com/2020/07/03/covid-parties-tuscaloosa-whats-really-going/}{reports
that students were gathering} to bet on who could get infected with the
virus first --- with the sickened winner taking home a pot of money ---
\href{https://abc3340.com/news/local/university-of-alabama-responds-to-covid-parties-being-thrown-in-tuscaloosa}{led
to warnings from the University of Alabama} to students about the
parties' risks, but state health officials were unable to confirm the
events even happened.

The idea seems to have its origin in a practice from the days before
there was a chickenpox vaccine. Some parents hosted chickenpox parties
to infect their children with the disease, as it was thought to be more
dangerous to contract as an adult.

The vaccine is the safest way to protect against chickenpox now that it
is available, though some,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/21/us/kentucky-governor-chickenpox.html}{including
former Gov. Matt Bevin} of Kentucky, still allowed their children to
participate in such gatherings to contract the illness.

A Covid party would be ``dangerous, irresponsible and potentially
deadly,'' said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill
Hospital in Manhattan.

``Attending such a party may be a path to an early demise, if not
chronic and unrelenting fatigue, chest pain, difficulty breathing and
daily fevers, if you do survive,'' Dr. Glatter said.

The coronavirus does not behave like the chickenpox, he said, and
deliberate infection with either virus is a bad idea.

The United States recently hit a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage\#map}{record
number} of new Covid-19 cases per day, with over 68,000 confirmed cases
on Friday.

Being infected by the coronavirus has yet to be proved to provide
immunity, so reinfection is still possible.

In an
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/opinion/coronavirus-parties-herd-immunity.html}{Op-Ed
article} for The Times, Dr. Greta Bauer, a professor of epidemiology and
biostatistics, warned against so-called coronavirus parties, noting that
even young people can be hospitalized and face long-term damage from the
virus.

``It is important that we don't take unnecessary risks with unknown
consequences,'' Dr. Bauer wrote. ``If we can avoid infection, we need to
do exactly that.''

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that people infected
with the coronavirus
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/considerations-for-events-gatherings.html}{should
not attend gatherings}, and that any event where people are mingling
without face coverings or social distancing is inherently high risk.

A California man
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/02/man-who-went-party-warned-people-not-be-an-idiot-like-me-day-before-dying-covid-19/}{died
from Covid-19 after going to a party} --- not held for the purpose of
infecting its attendees --- where people did not wear masks and an
infected person had attended.
