The unfounded ideas have been circulating online for months.

In a wide-ranging interview with the Fox News host Laura Ingraham on
Monday night, President Trump spread multiple conspiracy theories about
the protests that have erupted across the nation. Many of his unfounded
claims can be traced back to narratives that have been swirling online
for months.

Here are three of the baseless
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/us/politics/trump-conspiracy-theory-thugs-plane.html}{conspiracy
theories} that Mr. Trump spread and where they came from.

\hypertarget{a-plane-loaded-with-thugs-headed-to-the-republican-convention}{%
\subsection{A plane `loaded with thugs' headed to the Republican
convention.}\label{a-plane-loaded-with-thugs-headed-to-the-republican-convention}}

During the interview with Ms. Ingraham, Mr. Trump claimed that ``we had
somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend, and in the
plane it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark
uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that.''

Mr. Trump then alleged that the people were headed to Washington, D.C.,
to disrupt the Republican National Convention.

There is no evidence of a flight matching Mr. Trump's description. But
the claim is similar to a baseless allegation that appeared online as
early as June, when a wave of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/technology/antifa-local-disinformation.html}{cities
and towns became alarmed by unsubstantiated rumors} that the loose
collective of anti-fascist activists known as antifa was being sent into
their communities to disrupt the peace.

On June 1, a man from Emmett, Idaho, posted on Facebook: ``Be ready for
attacks downtown and residential areas. At least a dozen males got off
the plane in Boise from Seattle, dressed head to toe in black.'' He
claimed, ``One had a tattoo that said `Antifa America' on his arm.'' The
post was shared nearly 4,000 times.

That same day, the local sheriff's office posted that
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/1201021953344520/posts/3001368046643226}{there
was no merit to the rumor}. ``The Payette County Sheriff's Office has
not had contact with and has not verified that antifa is in Payette
County,'' it said. ``The Payette County Sheriff's Office has not given
any specific warnings to our citizens about antifa or other
organizations.'' It was shared only 716 times on Facebook.

The idea resurfaced prominently again last week when Senator Rand Paul,
a Republican from Kentucky, spoke about protesters who confronted him at
the Republican convention.

``You just think, `Oh, these are some normal hoodlums from a big city.'
I promise you that at least some of the members and the people who
attacked us were not from D.C.,'' Mr. Paul said,
\href{https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/28/protesters-confront-rand-paul-rnc-404223}{according
to Politico}. ``They flew here on a plane. They've all got fresh, new
clothes.''

Mr. Paul did not offer any evidence to support this assertion.

\subsection{Some `very stupid rich people' are bankrolling racial
justice protests across the
U.S.}\label{some-very-stupid-rich-people-are-bankrolling-racial-justice-protests-across-the-us}}

In the same Fox News interview, Mr. Trump said he believed ``some very
stupid rich people'' had been financing the racial justice protests that
took place in Washington last week and around the country in recent
months.

The unsupported idea echoes claims spread online for months that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/01/technology/george-floyd-misinformation-online.html}{George
Soros, the billionaire investor and Democratic donor, was funding
protests} against police brutality.

Mr. Soros has for years been cast as an
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/29/us/roseanne-george-soros-twitter.html}{anti-conservative
villain by a loose network of activists and political figures on the
right} and has become a convenient boogeyman for many different
conspiracies, including that he ``owns'' antifa and Black Lives Matter
groups.

Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization that Mr. Soros
founded, has donated to Black Lives Matter in the past. But so have
\href{https://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-lives-matter-network-establishes-12m-grant-fund/}{many
other public figures}, including Jay-Z, Beyoncé and Prince, just weeks
before he died.

The false notion that a shadowy cabal of Democratic elites like Mr.
Soros pulls strings behind the scenes and controls the world with money
is a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/what-is-qanon.html}{main
pillar of the far-right extremist conspiracy theory QAnon}.

\hypertarget{people-that-you-havent-heard-of-are-controlling-joseph-biden}{%
\subsection{`People that you haven't heard of' are controlling Joseph
Biden}\label{people-that-you-havent-heard-of-are-controlling-joseph-biden}}

This rumor, too, is a pillar of the baseless
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/what-is-qanon.html}{internet
conspiracy QAnon}. The theory states, falsely, that the world is run by
a group of Satan-worshiping pedophiles that is plotting against Mr.
Trump while operating a global child sex-trafficking ring.

QAnon followers, who number in the millions, believe that this clique
includes top Democrats like Mr. Soros, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
And they believe that real and actual political power resides not with
public candidates like Joseph R. Biden Jr. but with these individuals
exercising their secret power beyond any immediately visible public
link.

Since the start of the pandemic, as people in lockdown turned to the
internet for entertainment, membership in 10 large Facebook QAnon groups
grew more than 600 percent, a recent article by
\href{https://www.wsj.com/articles/qanon-booms-on-facebook-as-conspiracy-group-gains-mainstream-traction-11597367457}{The
Wall Street Journal said}. This year, QAnon has been a main faction
fueling false information about Covid-19, the Black Lives Matter
protests and the 2020 election. Followers have also attached themselves
to anti-vaccine and anti-child-trafficking movements, helping expand
their ranks.
